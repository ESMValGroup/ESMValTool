# R packages to be installed
# We support several installation procedures:

# Latest version from CRAN:
#  mypackage:

# Specific version from CRAN (use only if last version can not be used):
#   mypackage:
#     origin: cran
#     version: my_version

# The next ones are NOT allowed on final code, but we support them to
# facilitate developing and testing of recipes before merging if the CRAN
# version is not available yet

# From GitHub:
#   mypackage:
#     origin: github
#     path: my_user/my_packge_repo@my_version

# From a generic git:
#   mypackage:
#     origin: git
#     url: my_repo_url
#     ref: my_branch_commit_or_tag
