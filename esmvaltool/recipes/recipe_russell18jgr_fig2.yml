    Recipe for russell et al 18 figure 2. Plots zonal and annual means of 
    the zonal wind stress. Here, we are using tauuo, figures in russell18jgr
    paper were  made using tauuo, but tauu can also be used if tauuo file
    is not availble. To use tauu variable in this recipe just uncomment
    variable 'tauu' and add dataset names in additional datasets of 
    respective variable. If there are no dataset in a variable,
    entire variable section needs to be commented out.
