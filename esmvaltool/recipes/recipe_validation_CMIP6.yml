    Validation of CONTROL and EXPERIMENT datasets.
    This recipe produces standard comparison plots for two models
    and may include observational data. The standard comparison
    metrics are 2D lat-lon differences (between control and experiment),
    plain 2D lat-lon for each model, 1D (coordinate vs time)
    zonal and meridional means for both control and experiment models.
    Plots are produced for each season (winter DJF, spring MAM, summer JJA,
    autumn SON) and for the entire year.
    There are no restrictions in terms of data.
