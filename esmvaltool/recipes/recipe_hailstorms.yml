  title: Cliamte projections of extreme meteorological events such as hailstorms and lightning strokes
  description: |
    This recipe estimate the number of hail events and lightning strokes from the pdf of 200+ predictors
    derived from pressure level data of only 5 variables: geopotential, temperature, specific humidity,
    u-component of wind and v-component of wind. It also projects the number of hail events and lightning strokes
    in CMIP models
