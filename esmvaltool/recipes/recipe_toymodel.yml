    Tool for generating synthetic observations based on the model presented
    in Weigel et al. (2008) QJRS with an extension to consider non-stationary
    (2008) QJRS with an extension to consider non-stationary distributions
    distributions prescribing a linear trend. The toymodel allows to
    generate an aritifical forecast based on obsevations provided as input.
