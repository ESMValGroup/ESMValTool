# recipe_python_for_CI.yml
# 
# This recipe is identical to recipe_python.yml bar the extract_location
# preprocessor which is replaced here with extract_point. The reason for this
# is that this recipe is used solely for CI tests, and the geolocator/Nominatim
# engine for location extraction should not be used in CI runs as per their
# usage policy.
#
# See https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/recipes/recipe_examples.html
# for a description of this recipe.
