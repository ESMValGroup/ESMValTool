    This recipe provides quick insight into the spread and performance of multiple models.

    Many impact researchers do not have the time and finances to use a large
    ensemble of climate model runs for their impact analysis. To get an idea of
    the range of impacts of climate change it also suffices to use a small
    number of climate model runs. In case a system is only sensitive to annual
    temperature, one can select a run with a high change and one with a low
    change of annual temperature, preferably both with a low bias.
