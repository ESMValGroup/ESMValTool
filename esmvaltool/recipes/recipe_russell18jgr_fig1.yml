    Recipe for russell et al figure 1. Plots Annual-mean zonal wind stress 
    as polar contour map. Here, we are using tauuo. Figures in 
    russell18jgr paper were  made using tauuo, but tauu can also be used if
    tauuo file is not availble. To use tauu variable in this recipe just 
    uncomment variable 'tauu' and add dataset names in additional datasets of
    respective variable. If there are no dataset in a variable, entire variable
    section needs to be commented out.
