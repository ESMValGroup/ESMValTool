    Recipe for plotting runoff and ET diagnostics. The diagnostics calculates
    water balance components for different catchments and compares the results
    against observations. Currently, the required catchment mask needs to be
    downloaded manually at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2025776 and saved in
    the auxiliary_data_dir defined in config-user.yml.
