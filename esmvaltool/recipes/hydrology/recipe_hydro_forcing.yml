  description: |
    This recipe can be used to assess the agreement between forcing datasets
    (i.e. MSWEP, ERA5, ERA-Interim) for a certain catchment. The recipe can be
    used to:

    1. Plot a timeseries of the raw daily data
    2. Plot monthly aggregrated data over a certain period
    3. Plot the monthly climate statistics over a certain period
