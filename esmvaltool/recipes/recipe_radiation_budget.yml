  title: Radiation Budget
  description:
    This diagnostic analyses the radiation budget by separating top-of-atmosphere
    fluxes into clear-sky and cloud forcing components, and surface fluxes into
    downwelling and upwelling components. Model predictions are compared against
    three observational estimates, one of which (Stephens et al. 2012) includes
    uncertainty estimates. When the black error bars overlap the zero line, the
    model is consistent with observations according to Stephens et al. (2012).
