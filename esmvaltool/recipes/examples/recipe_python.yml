# @RCHG: Example modified to show more properties and made it more flexible. This means to change quickplot on shared
#        for example.
#        *Datasets* can be downloaded on CEDA for example. Loading of files is working fine but this recipe needed
#        changes on the main code to be able to work with Iris v2. I have added an if on preprocessors to detect which
#        Iris version is installed.
#
#        It has been added also a new keyword to quickplot in esmvaltool/diag_scripts/shared/plot/_plot.py
#        def quickplot(cube, filename, plot_type, maps=False, **kwargs):
#        now by default is maps=True it will plot the coastlines. Also the example now shows how to add kwargs to 
#        the iris quickplot by including them explicitly the example.
