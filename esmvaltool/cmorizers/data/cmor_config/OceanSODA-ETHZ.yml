# Common global attributes for Cmorizer output
# Note that the filename says version 'v2021a', but the file attribute and the
# documentation says 'v2021e'. Therefore, we use 'v2021e' here.

    comment: 'The original units of this variable are mumol/kg. To convert to the CMOR units mol/m3, we assume a constant sea water density of 1032 kg/m3, which is approximately the sea water density for T=4Â°C, salinity=35PSU, and p=100bar according to the UNESCO formula (UNESCO, 1981, Tenth report of the joint panel on oceanographic tables and standards, UNESCO Technical Papers in Marine Science, see https://www.wkcgroup.com/tools-room/seawater-density-calculator/ and https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm:978-3-319-18908-6/1.pdf).'
