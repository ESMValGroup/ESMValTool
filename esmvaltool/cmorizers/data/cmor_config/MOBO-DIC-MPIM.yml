# Variables to cmorize
variables:
  dissic:
    filename: MOBO-DIC_MPIM_monthly_clim.nc
    mip: Omon
    raw_name: DIC
    raw_units: '1e-6 mol kg-1'
    comment: 'The original units of this variable are mumol/kg. To convert to the CMOR units mol/m3, we assume a constant sea water density of 1032 kg/m3, which is approximately the sea water density for T=4°C, salinity=35PSU, and p=100bar according to the UNESCO formula (UNESCO, 1981, Tenth report of the joint panel on oceanographic tables and standards, UNESCO Technical Papers in Marine Science, see https://www.wkcgroup.com/tools-room/seawater-density-calculator/ and https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm:978-3-319-18908-6/1.pdf).'
