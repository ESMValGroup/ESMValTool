# Variables to cmorize
variables:
  nbp:
    mip: Lmon
    area: 148300000000000.0
    positive: down
    comment: 'The original unit of this dataset is GtC/yr. To be CMOR-compliant, the units are given relative to the land surface area of the Earth (given by the attribute area in m2 in this file).'
  nbp_residual:
    short_name: nbp
    mip: Lmon
    area: 148300000000000.0
    positive: down
    version_suffix: residual
    comment: 'The original unit of this dataset is GtC/yr. To be CMOR-compliant, the units are given relative to the land surface area of the Earth (given by the attribute area in m2 in this file). This version (with suffix _residual) of the dataset does not use the the output of the dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) to estimate the atmosphere-land carbon flux S_Land (which is then used to calculate nbp as nbp = S_Land - landuse change emissions), but calculates this as the residuals from other carbon fluxes, i.e., S_Land = Emissions - atmospheric growth - S_Ocean.'
  fgco2:
    mip: Omon
    area: 360000000000000.0
    positive: down
    comment: 'The original unit of this dataset is GtC/yr. To be CMOR-compliant, the units are given relative to the ocean surface area of the Earth (given by the attribute area in m2 in this file).'
