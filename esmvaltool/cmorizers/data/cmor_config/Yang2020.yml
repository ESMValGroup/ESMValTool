  comment: >-
    Time bounds of the climatology are set to 1971-2018 since measurements that
    serve as input for this data product have been conducted between 1971 and
    2018. This has been recommended by a co-author of the original publication
    (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921914117) via e-mail, but is NOT explicitly
    stated in the publication. Thus, the period given here needs to be treated
    with care.
