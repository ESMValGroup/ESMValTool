# Variables to CMORize
variables:

    mip: fx
    raw_name: cellArea_m2
  dpn2o:

    comment: >-
      Time bounds of the climatology are set to 1971-2018 since measurements
      that serve as input for this data product have been conducted between
      1971 and 2018. This has been recommended by a co-author of the original
      publication (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921914117) via e-mail, but is
      NOT explicitly stated in the original publication. Thus, the period given
      here needs to be treated with care.

      that serve as input for this data product have been conducted between
      1971 and 2018 (note that the wind products from ERA5 and CCMP, which are
      also used as input, are only available from 1988-2017 though). This has
      been recommended by a co-author of the original publication
      (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921914117) via e-mail, but is NOT
