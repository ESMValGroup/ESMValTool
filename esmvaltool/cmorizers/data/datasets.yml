      Australian Gridded Climate Data (AGCD) version 2 is the Bureau of Meteorology's official dataset for climate
      analyses covering analysis of monthly rainfall. The dataset provides consistent temporal and spatial analyses
      across Australia for each observed data variable. This accounts for spatial and temporal gaps in observations.
      Where possible, the gridded analysis techniques provide useful estimates in data-sparse regions
      such as central Australia.
      Time coverage: Site-based data are used to provide gridded climate data at the monthly timescale for rainfall (1900+).

      Data from NCI (National Computing Infrastructure Australia https://nci.org.au/),
      requires an NCI account and access to Gadi(Supercomputer in Canberra) and the project found in catalogue record.
      Access can be requested through NCI. NCI is an ESGF node (https://esgf.nci.org.au/projects/esgf-nci/)

      ANUClimate 2.0 consists of gridded daily and monthly climate variables across the terrestrial landmass of Australia
      from at least 1970 to the present. Rainfall grids are generated from 1900 to the present. The underpinning spatial
      models have been developed at the Fenner School of Environment and Society of the Australian National University.

      Caveats
        Make sure to select the right steps for accumulated fluxes, see:
            https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=56658233
            https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA-Interim%3A+monthly+means
        for a detailed explanation.
        The data are updated regularly: recent years are added, but also the past
        years are sometimes corrected. To have a consistent timeseries, it is
        therefore recommended to download the full timeseries and not just add
        new years to a previous version of the data.

      Caveats
        In contrast to the HadCRUT3 reformat script which produces temperature
        anomalies (relative to the 1961-90 climatology), this script calculates
        absolute tas by adding the climatology ("absolute.nc") to the anomalies
        ("HadCRUT.4.6.0.0.median.nc"). It creates 2 output, one with the
        temperature time-series and one with the anomaly time-series

      (Department of Earth and Environment, Boston University). See link above
      for more information.

      By default, this dataset is regridded to a 1°x1° grid (original resolution
      is 1/12°). If you want to use the original resolution, remove the `regrid`
      section in the configuration file (`LAI3g.yml`). Note that in this case,
      preprocessing the dataset with ESMValTool (i.e. every time you run the
      tool) can take a very long time (> 30 min).

        clwvi and clivi data are in-cloud values whereas CMIP5 models provide
