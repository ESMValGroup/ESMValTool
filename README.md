ESMValTool: A community diagnostic and performance metrics tool for routine evaluation of Earth system models in CMIP

# Getting started
This is the development branch for version 2 of ESMValTool. ESMValTool version 2 is under rapid development, an installation from source is recommended at the moment.

## Installing from source [recommended]
Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/blob/version2_development/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on installing ESMValTool from source.

## Installing from Anaconda
The Anaconda package can be found on [ESMValGroup Anaconda Channel.](https://anaconda.org/ESMValGroup)

First install gcc, g++ and gfortran if these are not available on your system. On Debian based systems, this can be done by
running `apt install build-essential gfortran`. In order to run
Julia diagnostics, you will also need to [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) version 1 or greater.

If you already installed Anaconda, you can install ESMValTool by running:
```
conda install -c esmvalgroup -c conda-forge esmvaltool
```

## Using Docker
ESMValTool Docker images are automatically generated by Docker Hub. Run the command below to pull the most recent ESMValTool image.
```
docker pull esmvalgroup/esmvaltool
```
Example use:
```
[sudo] docker run -ti esmvalgroup/esmvaltool
```

## Running ESMValTool
- Review `config-user.yml`. To customize for your system, create a copy, edit and use the command line option `-c` to instruct `esmvaltool` to use your custom configuration.
- Available recipes are located in the directory `esmvaltool/recipes`.
- Run e.g. `esmvaltool -c ~/config-user.yml examples/recipe_python.yml

## Getting help
The easiest way to get help if you cannot find the answer in the documentation on [readthedocs](https://esmvaltool.readthedocs.io), is to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues).

## Contributing
