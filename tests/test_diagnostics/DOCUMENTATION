* implement examle for reference solution --> test case with specific result!  --> runoff diagnostic ???



* implement tests for base diagnostics which we use in the CMUG diagnostics --> requires that code from Ben is part of the trunk







* send documentation with technical problems to Axel

* assign DOI to dummydata, easytest versions used for the deliverable
* ensure that the main documentation will include a section that runs the tests for checking that the installation did work properly




TODO
drwxrwxr-x 2 m300028 m300028 4096 Jan  2 09:16 test_namelist_sm_pr --> not working; find alternative names requested


PROBLEMS
drwxrwxr-x 2 m300028 m300028 4096 Dec 30 12:09 test_namelist_mjo_mean_state --> SOME MISSING FILE IS ANNOUNCED
drwxrwxr-x 2 m300028 m300028 4096 Jan  2 08:53 test_namelist_Evapotranspiration --> ERROR DUE O ERROR IN SCRIPT ANNOUNCED (perhaps NCL 6.3 problem)
perfmetric --> takes huge amounts of memory; does not work on laptop and stops with some strange error message --> try on machine with more memory



MISC
* deactivated version check in auxiliary.py; needs to be reactivated again!
* NCL copyright statement is printed as an NCL ERROR message which is kind of weird!
* dont use tabs for indention of python files!
* In the DOC directory, also the bulid results from sphinks are part of the SVN. This should not be the case! --> remove the build directory from the SVN repo
* error: Path /export/pa_data02/ESMVal/model/ defined in ./config_private_DLR-PA2.xml does not exist --> private path definitions should not be part of the reposittory content

SM_PR diagnostic
* requires installation of iris --> PENDING!



EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
* some error occurs that some file can not be generated, but it is there!
--> Pending!




RUNOFFET
* technically working, but incredibly slow for masking areas and caculating means
* files ro-et_coefficient_biases.png and ro-et_coefficient_biases.png are NOT unique! The filename is the same for different models; thus the results are overwritten by the last model investigated!


NAMELIST MJO MEAN STATE
* not working due to some NCL error!



PERFMETRIC
* some diagnostics in the perfmetric are based on only very short time periods! This is highly uncertaint!!!!
* sensitivity analysis on impact of length of period is required for each parameter! robustness vs. internal variability !!
* only one ensemble member is currently used instead of the multiensemble mean!; how is uncertainty inmodels and observations used in weighting the taylor metric??
