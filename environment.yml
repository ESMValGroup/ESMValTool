# Notes on ncl-cdo-R packages relation for future releases:
# cdo=1.9.6 works only with ncl=6.6.2 but that
# implies the use of R packages from the r channel
# and those packages are R=3.2.2 << 3.5.1 and are
# obsolete (installing ncl=6.6.2 automatically removes
# the conda-forge-installed R (3.5.1) packages

name: esmvaltool
