# conda-forge after conda switch to gcc7 (gxx conda compiler, Jan 2019)
# Notes on ncl-cdo-R packages relation for future releases:
# cdo=1.9.6 works only with ncl=6.6.2 but that
# implies the use of R packages from the r channel
# and those packages are R=3.2.2 << 3.5.1 and are
# obsolete (installing ncl=6.6.2 automatically removes
# the conda-forge-installed R (3.5.1) packages
# These issues are a direct consequence of changes in conda-forge
# related to the switch to gcc7(gxx-conda); hopefully they will be
# fixed in future releases of conda; also note that gxx_linux-64 may have
# to be added in the dependency list when switching from cf201901.
# Why use conda-forge/label/cf201901:
