beta11 05/22/2009  CAF
  -fixed deletion error in read_data.ncl and read_from_file.ncl
beta10 05/22/2009  CAF
  -Merged in Andrew Gettelman's code.
  -Change how field_numbers are handled.  In var_att files the Require line should 
   have a format of Requires: var:*3* var:*2*s ...  It's the field name, but with 
   wild cards for timeseries/climate letter, and monthly/inst/daily letter.
  -read_data and read_from_file calls also use the new format for the field number
   with the wild cards.  But the wild cards can be left out to force a field_name
  -Various other small bugs have been fixed.
  -T3I is processed for every three years before 2000 and after 2005.

   Still need to add the ability to process files, with and without dates in the filename.

beta09 03/20/2009   CAF
  Fixed problem with files created with 'none'
  Modified ccsm.ncl to save every third year for T3I fields before 1990 and
  after 2005
  Added Andrew G. diag_att, namelists, and changes in varatt
  Fixed issue in ccsm.ncl with handeling days since.
beta08 03/11/2009   CAF
  added some dble2flt to read in other model data
  fixed file check bug in ccsm.py
beta07  03/10/2009  CAF
  Fixed problem with derived variables looking for the wrong field number,
  thus looking for the wrong file.
  Known bugs
    This fix was hard coded to climatalogic files.

beta06  03/06/2009  CAF
   Removed date range from file names

beta05  03/06/2009  CAF
   var_att/toz_att.ncl was overwritten with an older version.  It's been fixed
   More known bugs.
     If a derived field file already exists, it is still recalculated.
beta04  03/05/2009  CAF

   Added niwa_beta02_modified plot_types from Hisako, hasn't been tested.
   Added var_att for toz, ztp, zctp, tatp, tactp, pctp, ptp
      xtp, zctp, tatp, tactp, pctp, ptp need to have long name and units defined.
      look at toz as an example.
   Modified ccsm.ncl to use less system memory.
   Also toz has a new format for the Required line  it is now variable:field  ie O3:T3*,PS:T2*s
      * is swapped with I or M depending on the field type defined in diag_att
   toz_att.ncl should be the new template for creating defined variables, it uses a function
      called add_data to make life easier.
   Known bugs
      -climate.ncl still looks for data in the first index
      -Filenames are of the format CCMVal2_wa3548_2x_refb0.1_WACCM_1_2015-2016_T3I_O3.nc
       should be CCMVal2_wa3548_2x_refb0.1_WACCM_1_T3I_O3_2015-2016.nc.  If you want to
       change this, I can give a list of files that need edited.
      -plotting has NOT been tested in awhile
      -In order for to get hyai, hybi, p0, hybm, hyai in the output files, project in the namelist
       should not be set to CCMVal2.  This is caused by the monthly files being saved on pressure
       levels.  I'm working on a fix for this.
      -If loading to much data into NCL, NCL can crash without any error messages.  This could happen
       if you're plotting several long model runs
      -Case insensitivity for filenames and variable names hasn't been added yet.

beta03  01/16/2009  CAF

 Fixed pressure level interpolation bug in ccsm.ncl
 Fixed same model different time period overwrite bug in read_data.ncl, extract_data.ncl
   and modify_data.ncl

  ./interface_scripts/ccsm.ncl   added interpolate to pressure levels

12/11/2008 CAF
  
  Fixed some bugs for the public beta release.

12/11/2008 CAF

  Cleaned up for public beta release.

12/02/2008 CAF

  First beta version.  To run ./main.py namelist

12/01/2008 CAF
   Altered code to be able to handle instantaneous fields.  Removed the startup message when NCL is called.
   added namelist_M, diag_att/convert_M to convert monthly fields, and add namelist_I, diag_att/convert_I to
   convert instantaneous fields.  Added several var_att fields. 
11/18/2008 CAF
  Added options to write climo directory and plots to plot directory.
  Also added dates to climo directory structure
11/17/2008 CAF
  Added debug variable usage.
11/5/2008 CAF
  All python netcdf and NCO operations have been moved to NCL.  Added keywords project and output_dir
11/3/2008 CAF
  Last version to require netcdf support for python, or NCO requirement

8/28/2008  CAF

   Changed lat,lon,lev in reformat to floats
   Added force_processing global var
   removed doubletofloat that I added to plot_type8/28/2008  CAF

8/25/2008  CAF
   Modified read_data.ncl to handle CCMValdiag formatted files
   main.py
     Added call ccsm.py module to handle ccsm h0 files.
     Added call to CF reformater cf_convert.py
     Added call to climat.py
   ccsm.py
     New module
   cf_convert.py
     New module
   reformat dir
     copied CF reformat to dir inside of diag_code      

   To test NCL you can try commenting out the calls to ccsm, cf_convert and climat in
   main.py.  You also might need to comment out some other lines in main.py.  Since
   I haven't tried this yet, I'm not sure on the exact lines.  There are some data
   files you can use on http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/fischer/data/, use the files with
   C2Ms, and C3M.
