Contributing a pull request review
==================================

In the ESMValTool community we use pull request reviews to ensure all code and
documentation contributions are of good quality.
An introduction to code reviews can be found in `The Turing Way`_, including
`why code reviews are important`_ and advice on
`how to have constructive reviews`_.

Most pull requests will need two reviews before they can be merged.
First a technical review takes place and then a scientific review.
Once both reviewers have approved a pull request, it can be merged.
These three steps are described in more detail below.
If a pull request contains only technical changes, e.g. a pull request that
corrects some spelling errors in the documentation or a pull request that
fixes some installation problem, a scientific review is not needed.

If you are a regular contributor, please try to review a bit more than two
other pull requests for every pull request you create yourself, to make sure
that each pull request gets the attention it deserves.

This team consists of contributors that have a strong interest and
experience in climate science.
