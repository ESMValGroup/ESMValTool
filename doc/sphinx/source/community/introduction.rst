Contribution guidelines
=======================

Contributions are very welcome
------------------------------

We greatly value contributions of any kind.
Contributions could include, but are not limited to documentation improvements, bug reports, new or improved diagnostic code, scientific and technical code reviews, infrastructure improvements, mailing list and chat participation, community help/building, education and outreach.
We value the time you invest in contributing and strive to make the process as easy as possible.
If you have suggestions for improving the process of contributing, please do not hesitate to propose them.

If you have a bug or other issue to report or just need help, please open an issue on the `issues tab on the
ESMValTool github
repository <https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues>`__.

If you would like to contribute a new diagnostic and recipe or a new
feature, please discuss your idea with the development team before
getting started, to avoid double work and/or disappointment later. A
good way to do this is to open an `issue on
GitHub <https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues>`__. This is
also a good way to get help.

Getting started
---------------

To install in development mode, follow these instructions.

-  `Download and install
   conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html>`__
   (this should be done even if the system in use already has a
   preinstalled version of conda, as problems have been reported with
   NCL when using such a version)
-  To make the ``conda`` command availble, add
   ``source <prefix>/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`` to your ``.bashrc`` file
   and restart your shell. If using (t)csh shell, add
   ``source <prefix>/etc/profile.d/conda.csh`` to your
   ``.cshrc``/``.tcshrc`` file instead.
-  Update conda: ``conda update -y conda``
-  Clone the ESMValTool public github repository:
   ``git clone git@github.com:ESMValGroup/ESMValTool``, or one of the
   private github repositories (e.g.
   ``git clone git@github.com:ESMValGroup/ESMValTool-private``)
-  Go to the esmvaltool directory: ``cd ESMValTool``
-  Create the esmvaltool conda environment
   ``conda env create --name esmvaltool --file environment.yml``
-  Activate the esmvaltool environment: ``conda activate esmvaltool``
-  Install in development mode: ``pip install -e '.[develop]'``. If you
   are installing behind a proxy that does not trust the usual pip-urls
   you can declare them with the option ``--trusted-host``, e.g.
   ``pip install --trusted-host=pypi.python.org --trusted-host=pypi.org --trusted-host=files.pythonhosted.org -e .[develop]``
-  If you want to use R diagnostics, run
   ``esmvaltool install R`` to install the R
   dependences. Note that if you only want to run the lint test for R
   scripts you will have to install the ``lintr`` package. You can do
   that by running ``Rscript esmvaltool/install/R/setup_devutils.R``.
-  If you want to use Julia diagnostics, first install Julia as
   described below in section “Installing Julia”, then run
   ``esmvaltool install Julia`` to install the Julia
   dependences. Install Julia dependences after R dependences if you
   plan to use both.
-  Test that your installation was succesful by running
   ``esmvaltool -h``.
-  If you log into a cluster or other device via ``ssh`` and your origin
   machine sends the ``locale`` environment via the ``ssh`` connection,
   make sure the environment is set correctly, specifically ``LANG`` and
   ``LC_ALL`` are set correctly (for GB English UTF-8 encoding these
   variables must be set to ``en_GB.UTF-8``; you can set them by adding
   ``export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8`` and ``export LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8`` in your
   origin or login machines’ ``.profile``)
-  Do not run ``conda update --update-all`` in the ``esmvaltool``
   environment since that will update some packages that are pinned to
   specific versions for the correct functionality of the environment.

Using the development version of the ESMValTool Core package
------------------------------------------------------------

If you need the latest developments of the ESMValTool Core package, you
can install it from source into the same conda environment. First follow
the steps above and then:

-  Clone the ESMValTool Core github repository:
   ``git clone git@github.com:ESMValGroup/ESMValCore``)
-  Go to the esmvalcore directory: ``cd ESMValCore``
-  Update the esmvaltool conda environment
   ``conda env update --name esmvaltool --file environment.yml``. This
   step is only needed if the dependencies changed since the latest
   release, which will rarely happen.
-  Activate the esmvaltool environment: ``conda activate esmvaltool``
-  Install ``esmvalcore`` in development mode:
   ``pip install -e '.[develop]'``.

Installing Julia
----------------

To run Julia diagnostics you will have to install Julia; the safest way
is to use the official pre-built executable and link it in the conda
environment:

-  Get the tarball (for v1.0.3 in this case):
   ``wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.0/julia-1.0.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz``
-  Unpack the tarball: ``tar xfz julia-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz``
-  Symlink the Julia executable into the conda environment:
   ``ln -s $PWD/julia-*/bin/julia $HOME/$ANACONDA/envs/esmvaltool/bin``
   (here ``$ANACONDA`` represents the name of your ``anaconda`` or
   ``miniconda`` directory, most commonly ``anaconda3`` or
   ``miniconda3``)
-  Check executable location: ``which julia``
-  Check Julia startup: ``julia --help``
-  Optionally install the Julia diagnostics dependencies:
   ``julia esmvaltool/install/Julia/setup.jl``

Note that sometimes, if you are under a firewall, the installation of
Julia diagnostics dependencies may fail due to failure of cloning the
references in ``$HOME/.julia/registries/General``. To fix this issue you
will have to touch the registry files:
``touch $HOME/.julia/environments/v1.0/Manifest.toml && touch $HOME/.julia/environments/v1.0/Project.toml``
and manually git clone the references:
``git clone https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git $HOME/.julia/registries/General``.

Running tests
-------------

Go to the directory where the repository is cloned and run
``pytest``. Tests will also be run automatically by
`CircleCI <https://circleci.com/gh/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool>`__.

Code style
----------

To increase the readability and maintainability or the ESMValTool source
code, we aim to adhere to best practices and coding standards. All pull
requests are reviewed and tested by one or more members of the core
development team. For code in all languages, it is highly recommended
that you split your code up in functions that are short enough to view
without scrolling.

We include checks for Python, R, NCL, and yaml files, most of which are
described in more detail in the sections below.
This includes checks for invalid syntax and formatting errors.
`Pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ is a handy tool that can run
all of these checks automatically.
It knows knows which tool to run for each filetype, and therefore provides
a simple way to check your code!

Pre-commit
~~~~~~~~~~

To run ``pre-commit`` on your code, go to the ESMValTool directory
(``cd ESMValTool``) and run

::

   pre-commit run

By default, pre-commit will only run on the files that have been changed,
meaning those that have been staged in git (i.e. after
``git add your_script.py``).

To make it only check some specific files, use

::

   pre-commit run --files your_script.py

or

::

   pre-commit run --files your_script.R

Alternatively, you can configure ``pre-commit`` to run on the staged files before
every commit (i.e. ``git commit``), by installing it as a `git hook <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks>`__ using

::

   pre-commit install

Pre-commit hooks are used to inspect the code that is about to be committed. The
commit will be aborted if files are changed or if any issues are found that
cannot be fixed automatically. Some issues cannot be fixed (easily), so to
bypass the check, run

::

   git commit --no-verify

or

::

   git commit -n

or uninstall the pre-commit hook

::

   pre-commit uninstall

Python
~~~~~~

The standard document on best practices for Python code is
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ and there is
`PEP257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`__ for
documentation. We make use of `numpy style
docstrings <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html>`__
to document Python functions that are visible on
`readthedocs <https://docs.esmvaltool.org>`__.

Most formatting issues in Python code can be fixed automatically by
running the commands

::

   isort some_file.py

to sort the imports in `the standard way <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`__
using `isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`__ and

::

   yapf -i some_file.py

to add/remove whitespace as required by the standard using `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`__,

::

   docformatter -i your_script.py

to run `docformatter <https://github.com/myint/docformatter>`__ which helps formatting the doc strings (such as line length, spaces).

To check if your code adheres to the standard, go to the directory where
the repository is cloned, e.g. ``cd ESMValTool``, and run `prospector <http://prospector.landscape.io/>`__

::

   prospector esmvaltool/diag_scripts/your_diagnostic/your_script.py

Run

::

   python setup.py lint

to see the warnings about the code style of the entire project.

We use `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__ on CircleCI to automatically check that there are
no formatting mistakes and Codacy for monitoring (Python) code quality.
Running prospector locally will give you quicker and sometimes more
accurate results.

NCL
~~~

Because there is no standard best practices document for NCL, we use
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ for NCL code as
well, with some minor adjustments to accomodate for differences in the
languages. The most important difference is that for NCL code the
indentation should be 2 spaces instead of 4. Use the command
``nclcodestyle /path/to/file.ncl`` to check if your code follows the
style guide.

R
~

Best practices for R code are described in `The tidyverse style
guide <https://style.tidyverse.org/>`__. We check adherence to this
style guide by using
`lintr <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/index.html>`__ on
CircleCI. Please use `styler <https://styler.r-lib.org/>`__ to
automatically format your code according to this style guide. In the
future we would also like to make use of
`goodpractice <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/goodpractice/index.html>`__
to assess the quality of R code.

YAML
~~~~

Please use ``yamllint`` to check that your YAML files do not contain
mistakes.

Any text file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A generic tool to check for common spelling mistakes is
`codespell <https://pypi.org/project/codespell/>`__.

Documentation
-------------

What should be documented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any code documentation that is visible on
`readthedocs <https://docs.esmvaltool.org>`__ should be well
written and adhere to the standards for documentation for the respective
language. Recipes should have a page in the *Recipes* section on
readthedocs. This is also the place to document recipe options for the
diagnostic scripts used in those recipes. Note that there is no need to
write extensive documentation for functions that are not visible on
readthedocs. However, adding a one line docstring describing what a
function does is always a good idea.

How to build the documentation locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the directory where the repository is cloned and run

::

   python setup.py build_sphinx -Ea

Make sure that your newly added documentation builds without warnings or
errors.

Branches, pull requests and code review
---------------------------------------

New development should preferably be done in the main ESMValTool github
repository, however, for scientists requiring confidentiality, private
repositories are available. The default git branch is ``master``. Use
this branch to create a new feature branch from and make a pull request
against. This
`page <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow>`__
offers a good introduction to git branches, but it was written for
BitBucket while we use GitHub, so replace the word BitBucket by GitHub
whenever you read it.

It is recommended that you open a `draft pull
request <https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/>`__
early, as this will cause CircleCI to run the unit tests and Codacy to
analyse your code. It’s also easier to get help from other developers if
your code is visible in a pull request.

You can view the results of the automatic checks below your pull
request. If one of the tests shows a red cross instead of a green
approval sign, please click the link and try to solve the issue. Note
that this kind of automated checks make it easier to review code, but
they are not flawless, so occasionally Codacy will report false
positives.

Diagnostic script contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pull request with diagnostic code should preferably not introduce new
Codacy issues. However, we understand that there is a limit to how much
time can be spend on polishing code, so up to 10 new (non-trivial)
issues is still an acceptable amount.

List of authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make a (significant) contribution to ESMValTool, please add your
name to the list of authors in CITATION.cff and regenerate the file
.zenodo.json by running the command

::

   pip install cffconvert
   cffconvert --ignore-suspect-keys --outputformat zenodo --outfile .zenodo.json

.. _How to make a release:

How to make a release
---------------------

To make a new release of the package, follow these steps:

1. Check that the nightly build on CircleCI was successful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the ``nightly`` `build on
CircleCI <https://circleci.com/gh/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/tree/master>`__.
All tests should pass before making a release.

2. Make a pull request to increase the version number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version number is stored in ``esmvaltool/__init__.py``,
``package/meta.yaml``, ``CITATION.cff``. Make sure to update all files. See
https://semver.org for more information on choosing a version number.

3. Make the release on GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the `releases
tab <https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/releases>`__ and draft
the new release. Do not forget to tick the pre-release box for a beta
release. Use the script
```esmvalcore/utils/draft_release_notes.py`` <https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/blob/master/esmvalcore/utils/draft_release_notes.py>`__
from the ESMValCore project to create a draft version of the release
notes and edit those.

4. Create and upload the Conda package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to create a new conda package:

-  Check out the tag corresponding to the release, e.g.
   ``git checkout v2.0.0b2``
-  Edit package/meta.yaml and uncomment the lines starting with
   ``git_rev`` and ``git_url``, remove the line starting with ``path``
   in the ``source`` section.
-  Activate the base environment ``conda activate base``
-  Run ``conda build package -c conda-forge -c esmvalgroup`` to build
   the conda package
-  If the build was successful, upload all the packages to the esmvalgroup
   conda channel, e.g.
   ``anaconda upload --user esmvalgroup /path/to/conda/conda-bld/noarch/esmvaltool-2.0.0b2-py_0.tar.bz2``.
