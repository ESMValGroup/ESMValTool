Diurnal cycle of convection
===========================

Overview
--------

The diurnal cycle of precipitation and radiative fluxes is closely related to the representation of boundary-layer turbulence and cumulus clouds, as well as to the triggering criteria of the deep convection scheme, which will give the onset of precipitation, and its closure, which in turn determines its intensity and duration. Associated clouds will have a different radiative impact given their timing of occurrence within the day. Thus, the evaluation of the representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation and radiative fluxes gives interesting insights into the progress achieved in the design and setup of physical parameterizations.

This diagnostic evaluates the representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over specific regions in the Tropics. The diurnal cycle is known to be different over land and ocean. Over land, the semi-arid Sahel region is contrasted with humid regions (Amazonia) as well as with the two monsoon regions West-Africa and India. Over the ocean, the diagnostic focuses on the Gulf of Guinea, the Indian Ocean and the East and West Equatorial Pacific. A harmonic analysis is done to provide global maps of the timing and amplitude of maximum rainfall with 3-hourly TRMM observations used as a reference.

Optionally, the analysis can be extended to include the diurnal cycle of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface (LW and SW, total and clear-sky components). 3-hourly CERES data are used as a reference derived from measurements at the top of the atmosphere and computed using a radiative transfer model at the surface.

The following diagnostic script is called by namelist_DiurnalCycle_harmonic.xml:

* DiurnalCycle_precip_harmonic.ncl: computes the amplitude, phase and percentage of the variance of the first harmonic of the mean diurnal cycle of precipitation by season over the globe. 3-hr mean precipitation outputs are used and interpolated onto a common 2.5°x2.5° grid.

The following diagnostic script is called by namelist_DiurnalCycle_box_pr.xml, namelist_DiurnalCycle_box_SFCflux.xml, namelist_DiurnalCycle_box_TOAflux.xml:

* DiurnalCycle_box.ncl: computes the mean diurnal cycle of precipitation and available radiative fluxes over specific regions and seasons. Regions include Sahel (Sahel, 12°N-23°N, 10°E-10°W), West-Africa (WestAf, 4°N-10°N, 8°E-8°W), Gulf of Guinea (GoG, 2°S-4°N, 8°E-8W), Amazonia (Amazon, 15°S-0°, 70°W-50°W), India (India, 12°N-20°N, 75°E-80°E), Indian Ocean (IO, 10°S-5°N, 70°E-90°E), East-Equatorial Pacific (EEP, 0°-10°N, 110°W-90°W) and West-Equatorial Pacific (WEP, 0°-20°N, 130°E-150°E). Seasons include DJF, MAM, JJA and SON.
