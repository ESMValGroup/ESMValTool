Catchment analysis
=====================

Overview
--------

This diagnostic calculates biases of long-term climatological annual means
of total runoff, precipitation and evapotranspiration for 12 large-scale
catchments on different continents and climates. For total runoff, catchment
averaged model values are compared to climatological GRDC station
observations of river runoff (Dümenil Gates et al., 2000). Due to the
incompleteness of these station data, a year-to-year correspondence of data
cannot be achieved in a generalized way, so that only climatological data
are considered, such it has been done in Hagemann et al. (2013).
For precipitation, catchment-averaged WFDEI precipitation 
(Weedon et al., 2014) data from 1979-2010 is used as reference.
For evapotranspiration, observations are estimated using the difference
of the above mentioned precipitation reference minus the climatological
GRDC river runoff.
