Combined Climate Extreme Index
====================================================

Overview
--------

The goal of this diagnostic is to compute time series of a number of extreme events: heatwave, coldwave, heavy precipitation, drought and high wind. Then, the user can combine these different components (with or without weights). The result is an index similar to the Climate Extremes Index (CEI; Karl et al., 1996), the modified CEI (mCEI; Gleason et al., 2008) or the Actuaries Climate Index (ACI; American Academy of Actuaries, 2018). The output consists of a netcdf file containing the area-weighted and multi-model multi-metric index. This recipe can be applied to data with any temporal resolution, and the running average is computed based on the user-defined window length (e.g. a window length of 5 would compute the 5-day running mean when applied to data, or 5-month running mean when applied to monthly data).

In recipe_extreme_index.yml, after defining the area and reference and projection period, the weigths for each metric selected. The options are

* weight_t90p the weight of the number of days when the maximum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile,

* weight_t10p the weight of the number of days when the minimum temperature falls below the 10th percentile,

* weight_Wx the weight of the number of days when wind power (third power of wind speed) exceeds the 90th percentile,

* weight_cdd the weight of the maximum length of a dry spell, defined as the maximum number of consecutive days when the daily precipitation is lower than 1 mm, and

* weight_rx5day the weight of the maximum precipitation accumulated during 5 consecutive days.

   *Required settings for script*

   *   weight_t90p: 0.2 (from 0 to 1, the total sum of the weight should be 1)
   *   weight_t10p: 0.2 (from 0 to 1, the total sum of the weight should be 1)
   *   weight_Wx: 0.2 (from 0 to 1, the total sum of the weight should be 1)
   *   weight_rx5day: 0.2 (from 0 to 1, the total sum of the weight should be 1)
   *   weight_cdd: 0.2 (from 0 to 1, the total sum of the weight should be 1)
   *   running_mean: 5 (depends on the length of the future projection period selected, but recommended not greater than 11)
