Land-surface Permafrost - Autoassess diagnostics
================================================

Overview
--------

Permafrost thaw is an important impact of climate change, and is the source of
a potentially strong Earth system feedback through the release of soil carbon
into the atmosphere. This recipe provides metrics that evaluate the
climatological performance of models in simulating soil temperatures that
control permafrost. Performance metrics (with observation-based estimates in brackets):

* permafrost area (17.46 million square km)
* fractional area of permafrost northwards of zero degree isotherm (0.47)
* soil temperature at 1m minus soil temperature at surface (-0.53 degrees C)
* soil temperature at surface minus air temperature (6.15 degrees C)
* annual amplitude at 1m / annual amplitude at the surface (0.40 unitless)
* annual amplitude at the surface / annual air temperature (0.57 unitless)


Plots:

* Maps of permafrost extent and zero degC isotherm
* Normalised assessment metrics plot comparing control and experiment

The recipe takes as input a control model and experimental model, comparisons being made
with these two models.

Additional notes on usage
-------------------------
The ``landsurface_permafrost`` area metric is part of the ``esmvaltool/diag_scripts/autoassess`` diagnostics,
and, as any other ``autoassess`` metric, it uses the ``autoassess_area_base.py`` as general purpose
wrapper. This wrapper accepts a number of input arguments that are read through from the recipe.

This recipe is part of the larger group of Autoassess metrics ported to ESMValTool
from the native Autoassess package from the UK's Met Office. The ``diagnostics`` settings
are almost the same as for the other Autoassess metrics.

.. note::

   **Time gating for autoassess metrics.**

   To preserve the native Autoassess functionalities,
   data loading and selection on time is done somewhat
   differently for ESMValTool's autoassess metrics: the
   time selection is done in the preprocessor as per usual but
   a further time selection is performed as part of the diagnostic.
   For this purpose the user will specify a ``start:`` and ``end:``
   pair of arguments of ``scripts: autoassess_script`` (see below
   for example). These are formatted as ``YYYY/MM/DD``; this is
   necessary since the Autoassess metrics are computed from 1-Dec
   through 1-Dec rather than 1-Jan through 1-Jan. This is a temporary
   implementation to fully replicate the native Autoassess functionality
   and a minor user inconvenience since they need to set an extra set of
   ``start`` and ``end`` arguments in the diagnostic; this will be phased
   when all the native Autoassess metrics have been ported to ESMValTool
   review has completed.


An example of standard inputs as read by ``autoassess_area_base.py`` and passed
over to the diagnostic/metric is listed below.
