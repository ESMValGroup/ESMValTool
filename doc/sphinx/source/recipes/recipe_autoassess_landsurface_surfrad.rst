Land-surface Surface Radiation - Autoassess diagnostics
=======================================================

Overview
--------

The simulation of surface radiation is central to all aspects of model
performance, and can often reveal compensating errors which are hidden within
top of atmosphere fluxes. This recipe provides metrics that evaluate the skill
of models' spatial and seasonal distribution of surface shortwave and longwave
radiation against the CERES EBAF satellite dataset.

Performance metrics:

* median absolute error (model minus observations) net surface shortwave (SW) radiation
* median absolute error (model minus observations) net surface longwave (LW) radiation

Metrics are calculated using model and observation multi-year climatologies (seasonal means) 
for meteorological seasons:
* December-January-February (djf)
* March-April-May (mam)
* June-July-August (jja)
* September-October-November (son)
* Annual mean (ann)


Plots:

* Normalised assessment metrics plot comparing control and experiment

The recipe takes as input a control model and experimental model, comparisons being made
with these two models.

Inputs and usage
----------------
The ``landsurface_soilmoisture`` area metric is part of the ``esmvaltool/diag_scripts/autoassess`` diagnostics,
and, as any other ``autoassess`` metric, it uses the ``autoassess_area_base.py`` as general purpose
wrapper. This wrapper accepts a number of input arguments that are read through from the recipe.

This recipe is part of the larger group of Autoassess metrics ported to ESMValTool
from the native Autoassess package from the UK's Met Office. The ``diagnostics`` settings
are almost the same as for the other Autoassess metrics.

.. note::

   **Time gating for autoassess metrics.**

   To preserve the native Autoassess functionalities,
   data loading and selection on time is done somewhat
   differently for ESMValTool's autoassess metrics: the
   time selection is done in the preprocessor as per usual but
   a further time selection is performed as part of the diagnostic.
   For this purpose the user will specify a ``start:`` and ``end:``
   pair of arguments of ``scripts: autoassess_script`` (see below
   for example). These are formatted as ``YYYY/MM/DD``; this is
   necessary since the Autoassess metrics are computed from 1-Dec
   through 1-Dec rather than 1-Jan through 1-Jan. This is a temporary
   implementation to fully replicate the native Autoassess functionality
   and a minor user inconvenience since they need to set an extra set of
   ``start`` and ``end`` arguments in the diagnostic; this will be phased
   when all the native Autoassess metrics have been ported to ESMValTool
   review has completed.


An example of standard inputs as read by ``autoassess_area_base.py`` and passed
over to the diagnostic/metric is listed below.
