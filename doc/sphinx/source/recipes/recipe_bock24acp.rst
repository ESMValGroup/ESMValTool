Example plots
-------------

.. _fig_bock24acp_1:
.. figure::  /recipes/figures/bock24acp/map_netcre.png
   :align:   center

   Geographical map of the multi-year annual mean net cloud radiative effect from
   (a) CERES–EBAF Ed4.2 (OBS) and (b–d) group means of historical CMIP simulations
   from all three ECS groups (Fig. 4).

.. _fig_bock24acp_2:
.. figure::  /recipes/figures/bock24acp/zonal_diff_clt_ssp585.png
   :align:   center

   The upper panel show the zonally averaged group means of total cloud
   fraction from historical simulations (solid lines)
   and RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 scenarios (dashed lines) for the three different ECS groups.
   Lower panels show the corresponding relative differences of all zonally
   averaged group means between the RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 scenarios and the corresponding
   historical simulations. Shading indicates the 5 % and 95 % quantiles of the single
   model results (Fig. 6a).

.. _fig_bock24acp_3:
.. figure::  /recipes/figures/bock24acp/boxplot_ssp585_south_oc.png
   :align:   center

   Relative change (calculated as the difference between the scenario value and the
   historical value divided by the historical value) of total cloud fraction (clt),
   ice water path (iwp), liquid water path (lwp), and net cloud radiative effect
   (netcre) per degree of warming averaged over the Southern Ocean (30–65°S). In the
   box plot, each box indicates the range from the first
   quartile to the third quartile, the vertical line shows the median, and the
   whiskers the minimum and maximum values, excluding the outliers. Outliers are
   defined as being outside 1.5 times the interquartile range (Fig. 7b).
