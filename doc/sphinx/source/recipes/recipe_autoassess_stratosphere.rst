Autoassess Stratosphere
=======================

Overview
--------

Polar night jet / easterly jet strengths are defined as the maximum / minimum wind
speed of the climatological zonal mean jet, and measure how realistic the zonal
wind climatology is in the stratosphere.

Extratropical temperature at 50hPa (area averaged poleward of 60 degrees) is important
for polar stratospheric cloud formation (in winter/spring), determining the amount of
heterogeneous ozone depletion simulated by models with interactive chemistry schemes.

The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a good measure of tropical variability in the
stratosphere.  Zonal mean zonal wind at 30hPa is used to define the period and amplitude
of the QBO.

The tropical tropopause cold point (100hPa, 10S-10N) temperature is an important factor in
determining the stratospheric water vapour concentrations at entry point (70hPa, 10S-10N),
and this in turn is important for the accurate simulation of stratospheric chemistry and
radiative balance.

Review of current port in ESMValTool
------------------------------------
The code and results review of the port from native Autoassess to ESMValTool
was conducted by Alistair Sellar (`<alistair.sellar@matoffice.gov.uk>`_) and
Valeriu Predoi (`<valeriu.predoi@ncas.ac.uk>`_) in July 2019. Review consisted in
comparing results from runs using ESMValTool's port and native Autoassess using
the same models and data stretches.

The recipe takes as input a control model and experimental model, comparisons being made
with these two CMIP models; additionally it can take observational data s input, in the
current implementation ERA-Interim.

Inputs and usage
----------------
The ``stratosphere`` area metric is part of the ``esmvaltool/diag_scripts/autoassess`` diagnostics,
and, as any other ``autoassess`` metric, it uses the ``autoassess_area_base.py`` as general purpose
wrapper. This wrapper accepts a number of input arguments that are read through from the recipe. 

This recipe is part of the larger group of Autoassess metrics ported to ESMValTool
from the native Autoassess package from the UK's Met Office. The ``diagnostics`` settings
are almost the same as for the other Atoassess metrics.

.. note::

   **Time gating for autoassess metrics.**

   To preserve the native Autoassess functionalities,
   data loading and selection on time is done somewhat
   differently for ESMValTool's autoassess metrics: the
   time selection is done in the preprocessor as per usual but
   a further time selection is performed as part of the diagnostic.
   For this purpose the user will specify a ``start:`` and ``end:``
   pair of arguments of ``scripts: autoassess_script`` (see below
   for example). These are formatted as ``YYYY/MM/DD``; this is
   necessary since the Autoassess metrics are computed from 1-Dec
   through 1-Dec rather than 1-Jan through 1-Jan. This is a temporary
   implementation to fully replicate the native Autoassess functionality
   and a minor user inconvenience since they need to set an extra set of
   ``start`` and ``end`` arguments in the diagnostic; this will be phased
   when all the native Autoassess metrics hanve been ported to ESMValTool
   review has completed.

.. note::

   **Polar Night/Easterly Jets Metrics**

   Polar Night Jets (PNJ) metrics require data available at very low air pressures
   ie very high altitudes; both Olar Night Jet and Easterly Jets computations should
   be preformed using ``ta`` and ``ua`` data at ``<< 100 Pa``; the lowest air pressure
   found in atmospheric CMOR mip tables corresponds to ``plev39`` air pressure table,
   and is used in the ``AERmonZ`` mip. If the user requires correct calculations of these
   jets, it is highly advisable to use data from ``AERmonZ``. Note that standard QBO
   calculation is exact for ``plev17`` or ``plev19`` tables.

An example of standard inputs as read by ``autoassess_area_base.py`` and passed
over to the diagnostic/metric is listed below.

Results from ``u-bc179`` have been obtained by running the native Autoassess/stratosphere
on ``.pp`` data from UKESM1 ``u-bc179`` suite and are listed here to confirm the 
compliance between the ported Autoassess metric in ESMValTool and the original native metric.
