Physical Climate at Global Warming Levels (GWLs)
==================================================

Overview
--------

This recipe calculates years of Global Warming Level (GWL) exceedances in CMIP
models as described in `Swaminathan et al (2022)`. Time series of the
anomalies in annual global mean surface air temperature (GSAT)
are calculated with respect to the 1850-1900 time-mean of each
individual time series. To limit the influence of short-term variability,
a 21-year centered running mean is applied to the time series. The year at
which the time series exceeds warming levels or temperatures such as 1.5C
is then recorded for the specific model ensemble member and future scenario.
Once the years of exceedance are calculated, the time averaged global
mean and standard deviation for the multimodel ensemble
over the 21-year period around the year of exceedance are plotted.
By selecting specific scenarios, the multimodel mean and spread for a single
future scenario can be plotted as shown in the examples below.
