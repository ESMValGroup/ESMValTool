Seaice feedback
===============


Overview
--------

In this recipe, one process-based diagnostic named the
Ice Formation Efficiency (IFE) is computed based on monthly mean
sea-ice volume estimated north of 80°N. The choice of this domain
is motivated by the desire to minimize the influence of dynamic
processes but also by the availability of sea-ice thickness measurements.
The diagnostic intends to evaluate the strength of the negative sea-ice
thickness/growth feedback, which causes late-summer negative anomalies
in sea-ice area and volume to be partially recovered during the next
growing season. A chief cause behind the existence of this feedback is
the non-linear inverse dependence between heat conduction fluxes and
sea-ice thickness, which implies that thin sea ice grows faster than thick
sea ice. To estimate the strength of that feedback, anomalies of the annual
minimum of sea-ice volume north of 80°N are first estimated. Then,
the increase in sea-ice volume until the next annual maximum is computed
for each year. The IFE is defined as the regression of this ice volume
production onto the baseline summer volume anomaly.
