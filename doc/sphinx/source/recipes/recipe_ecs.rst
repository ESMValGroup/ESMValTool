Equilibrium climate sensitivity
===============================

Overview
--------


Equilibrium climate sensitivity is defined as the change in global mean
temperature as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric CO\ :sub:`2`
concentration compared to pre-industrial times after the climate system has
reached a new equilibrium `Gregory et al. (2004)`_. This recipe uses a
regression method based on `Andrews et al. (2012)`_ to calculate it for
several CMIP model.
