IPCC AR5 Chapter 9 (selected figures)
=====================================

Overview
--------

The goal of this recipe is to collect diagnostics to reproduce Chapter 9 of AR5,
so that the plots can be readily reproduced and compared to previous CMIP
versions. In this way we can next time start with what was available in the
previous round and can focus on developing more innovative methods of analysis
rather than constantly having to "re-invent the wheel".

.. note::

    Please note that most recipes have been modified to include only models that are 
    (still) readily available via ESGF. Plots produced may therefore look different 
    than the original figures from IPCC AR5.

The plots are produced collecting the diagnostics from individual recipes. The
following figures from Flato et al. (2013) can currently be reproduced:

    * Figure 9.2 a,b,c: Annual-mean surface air temperature for the period
      1980-2005. a) multi-model mean, b) bias as the difference between the
      CMIP5 multi-model mean and the climatology from ERA-Interim
      (Dee et al., 2011), c) mean absolute model error with respect to the
      climatology from ERA-Interim.

    * Figure 9.3: Seasonality (December-January-February minus June-July-August)
      of surface (2 m) air temperature (°C) for the period 1980-2005.
      (a) Multi-model mean for the historical experiment. (b) Multi-model mean
      of absolute seasonality. (c) Difference between the multi-model mean
      and the ERA-Interim reanalysis seasonality. (d) Difference between the
      multi-model mean and the ERA-Interim absolute seasonality.

    * Figure 9.4: Annual-mean precipitation rate (mm day-1) for the period
      1980-2005. a) multi-model mean, b) bias as the difference between the
      CMIP5 multi-model mean and the climatology from the Global Precipitation
      Climatology Project (Adler et al., 2003), c) multi-model mean absolute
      error with respect to observations, and d) multi-model mean error
      relative to the multi-model mean precipitation itself.

    * Figure 9.5: Climatological (1985-2005) annual-mean cloud radiative
      effects in Wm-2 for the CMIP5 models against CERES EBAF (2001-2011) in
      Wm-2. Top row shows the shortwave effect; middle row the longwave effect,
      and bottom row the net effect. Multi-model-mean biases against CERES
      EBAF 2.6 are shown on the left, whereas the right panels show zonal
      averages from CERES EBAF 2.6 (black), the individual CMIP5 models (thin
      gray lines), and the multi-model mean (thick red line).

    * Figure 9.6: Centered pattern correlations between models and observations
      for the annual mean climatology over the period 1980–1999. Results are
      shown for individual CMIP3 (black) and CMIP5 (blue) models as thin
      dashes, along with the corresponding ensemble average (thick dash) and
      median (open circle). The four variables shown are surface air
      temperature (TAS), top of the atmosphere (TOA) outgoing longwave
      radiation (RLUT), precipitation (PR) and TOA shortwave cloud radiative
      effect (SW CRE). The correlations between the reference and alternate
      observations are also shown (solid green circles).

    * Figure 9.8: Observed and simulated time series of the anomalies in annual
      and global mean surface temperature. All anomalies are differences from
      the 1961-1990 time-mean of each individual time series. The reference
      period 1961-1990 is indicated by yellow shading; vertical dashed grey
      lines represent times of major volcanic eruptions. Single simulations
      for CMIP5 models (thin lines); multi-model mean (thick red line);
      different observations (thick black lines). Dataset pre-processing like
      described in Jones et al., 2013.

    * Figure 9.14: Sea surface temperature plots for zonal mean error, equatorial
      (5 deg north to 5 deg south) mean error, and multi model mean for zonal error
      and equatorial mean.

    * Figure 9.24: Time series of (a) Arctic and (b) Antarctic sea ice extent;
      trend distributions of (c) September Arctic and (d) February Antarctic
      sea ice extent.

    * Figure 9.26: Ensemble-mean global ocean carbon uptake (a) and global land
      carbon uptake (b) in the CMIP5 ESMs for the historical period 1900–2005.
      For comparison, the observation-based estimates provided by the Global
      Carbon Project (GCP) are also shown (thick black line). The confidence
      limits on the ensemble mean are derived by assuming that the CMIP5 models
      are drawn from a t-distribution. The grey areas show the range of annual mean
      fluxes simulated across the model ensemble. This figure includes results
      from all CMIP5 models that reported land CO2 fluxes, ocean CO2 fluxes, or
      both (Anav et al., 2013).

    * Figure 9.27: Simulation of global mean (a) atmosphere–ocean CO2 fluxes
      ("fgCO2") and (b) net atmosphere–land CO2 fluxes ("NBP"), by ESMs for the
      period 1986–2005. For comparison, the observation-based estimates
      provided by Global Carbon Project (GCP) and the Japanese Meteorological
      Agency (JMA) atmospheric inversion are also shown. The error bars for the
      ESMs and observations represent interannual variability in the fluxes,
      calculated as the standard deviation of the annual means over the period
      1986–2005.

    * Figure 9.38: Seasonal cycle for the surface temperature or precipitation 
      over land within defined regions multi-model mean and difference to 
      reference dataset or absolute annual cycle can be chosen.

    * Figure 9.39: Seasonal bias box and whiskers plot 
      for surface temperature or precipitation within
      SREX (IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and
      Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation) regions.

    * Figure 9.40: Seasonal bias box and whiskers plot for surface 
      temperature or precipitation within defined polar and ocean regions.

    * Figure 9.41b: Comparison between observations and models for variable
      values within defined regions.

    * Figure 9.42a: Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) against the global
      mean surface air temperature, both for the period 1961-1990 and for the
      pre-industrial control runs.

    * Figure 9.42b: Transient climate response (TCR) against equilibrium climate
      sensitivity (ECS).

    * Figure 9.45a: Scatterplot of springtime snow-albedo effect values in climate
      change vs. springtime d(alpha\ :sub:`s`\)/d(T\ :sub:`s`\) values in the seasonal
      cycle in transient climate change experiments (Hall and Qu, 2006).

   Figure 9.6: Centered pattern correlations between models and observations
   for the annual mean climatology over the period 1980–1999. Results are
   shown for individual CMIP3 (black) and CMIP5 (blue) models as thin
   dashes, along with the corresponding ensemble average (thick dash) and
   median (open circle). The four variables shown are surface air
   temperature (TAS), top of the atmosphere (TOA) outgoing longwave
   radiation (RLUT), precipitation (PR) and TOA shortwave cloud radiative
   effect (SW CRE). The correlations between the reference and alternate
   observations are also shown (solid green circles).

   the 1961-1990 time-mean of each individual time series. The reference
   period 1961-1990 is indicated by yellow shading; vertical dashed grey
   lines represent times of major volcanic eruptions. Single simulations
   for CMIP5 models (thin lines); multi-model mean (thick red line);
   different observations (thick black lines). Dataset pre-processing like
   described in Jones et al., 2013.

   Figure 9.14: (a) Zonally averaged sea surface temperature (SST) error
   in CMIP5 models. (b) Equatorial SST error in CMIP5 models. (c) Zonally

   inter-model standard deviation (shading). (d) Equatorial multi-model
   mean SST in CMIP5 together with inter-model standard deviation
   (shading) and observations (black).  Model climatologies are derived
   from the 1979-1999 mean of the historical simulations. The Hadley
   Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) (Rayner et
   al., 2003) observational climatology for 1979-1999 is used as a
   reference for the error calculation (a), (b), and (c); and for
   observations in (d).

   ESMs for the historical period 1900–2005.  For comparison, the
   observation-based estimates provided by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) are
   also shown (black line). The confidence limits on the ensemble mean are
   derived by assuming that the CMIP5 models come from a t-distribution. The
   grey areas show the range of annual mean fluxes simulated across the model
   ensemble.
