Emergent constraints on carbon cycle feedbacks
==============================================

Overview
--------

Figures from Wenzel et al. (2014) are reproduced with recipe_wenzel14jgr.yml. Variables relevant for the carbon cycle - climate feedback such as near surface air temperature (tas), net biosphere productivity (nbp) and carbon flux into the ocean (fgco2) are analyzed for coupled (1pctCO2, here the carbon cycle is fully coupled to the climate response) and uncoupled (esmFixCLim1, here the carbon cycle is uncoupled to the climate response) simulations. The standard namelist includes a comparison of cumulated nbp from coupled and uncoupled simulations and includes a set of routines to diagnose the long-term carbon cycle - climate feedback parameter (GammaLT) from an ensemble of CMIP5 models. Also included in the recipe is a comparison of the interannual variability of nbp and fgco2 for historical simulations used to diagnose the observable sensitivity of CO2 to tropical temperature changes (GammaIAV). As a key figure of this recipe, the diagnosed values from the models GammaLT vs. GammaIAV are compared in a scatter plot constituting an emergent constraint.

   Carbon cycle-climate feedback of tropical land carbon vs. the sensitivity of co2flux to interannual temperature variability in the tropics (30S to 30N). The red line shows the linear best fit of the regression together with the prediction error (orange shading) and the gray shading shows the observed range.
