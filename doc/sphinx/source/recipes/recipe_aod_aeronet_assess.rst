AOD AeroNET Assess
==================

Overview
--------

This diagnostic evaluates model aerosol optical depth (AOD) against ground
based observations from the AeroNET measurement network. Monthly mean AOD
data is downloaded from the AeroNET website and formatted (CMORized) using the
AERONET downloader and formatter within ESMValTool.

Multiannual seasonal means are calculated from the model output and compared
with a multiannual seasonal mean climatology generated from AeroNET
observational data. At each AeroNET station the data are screened for validity
according to the following default criteria:

  * 1. Monthly means must be generated from at least one AOD observation in that
    month.

  * 2. Seasonal means for DJF, MAM, JJA and SON must be calculated from three 
    monthly means, i.e. a monthly mean from December January and Feburary.

  * 3. For a given year to be valid, there must be a seasonal mean for each climate
    season i.e. DJF, MAM, JJA and SON.

  * 4. For a multiannual seasonal means there must be at least five seasonaal means
    over the time range of interest.

NOTE: The code is designed to be flexible and the default criteria can be 
changed according to the user's requirements (see the user settings below).  

The evaluation is visualised by plotting model output as 2D filled contours and
overlaying AeroNET observations at model grid cells co-located with the AeroNET
measurement stations. Statistical data (root mean square error) is generated
using AeroNET observations at model grid cells co-located with the AeroNET
measurement stations.

Observations and reformat scripts
---------------------------------

* Note: (1) obs4MIPs data can be used directly without any preprocessing; (2) 
  see headers of reformat scripts for non-obs4MIPs data for download
  instructions.

* The AeroNET data is downloaded from the AeroNET website using the downloader:

  .. code-block:: yaml

        $ esmvaltool data download AERONET.

* The AeroNET data is formatteed (CMORized) using the formatter:

  .. code-block:: yaml

        $ esmvaltool data format AERONET.
