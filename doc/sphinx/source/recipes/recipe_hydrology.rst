Hydrological models - data pre-processing
=========================================

Overview
--------

We provide a collection of scripts that pre-processes environmental data for use in several hydrological models:

PCR-GLOBWB
**********
PCR-GLOBWB (PCRaster Global Water Balance) is a large-scale hydrological model intended for global to regional studies and developed at the Department of Physical Geography, Utrecht University (Netherlands). The recipe pre-processes ERA-Interim reanalyses data for use in the PCR-GLOBWB.

MARRMoT
**********
MARRMoT (Modular Assessment of Rainfall-Runoff Models Toolbox) is a rainfall-runoff model comparison framework that allows objective comparison between different conceptual hydrological model structures https://github.com/wknoben/MARRMoT. The recipe pre-processes ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyses data for use in the MARRMoT.

MARRMoT requires potential evapotranspiration (evspsblpot). The variable evspsblpot is not available in ERA-Interim. Thus, we use the debruin function (De Bruin et al. 2016) to obtain evspsblpot using both ERA-Interim and ERA5. This function needs the variables tas, psl, rsds, and rsdt as input.

wflow_sbm and wflow_topoflex
****************************
Forcing data for the `wflow_sbm <https://wflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wflow_sbm.html>`_
and `wflow_topoflex <https://wflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wflow_topoflex.html>`_
hydrological models can be prepared using recipe_wflow.yml.
If PET is not available from the source data (e.g. ERA-Interim), then it can be derived from psl, rsds and rsdt using De Bruin's 2016 formula (De Bruin et al. 2016). For daily ERA5 data, the time points of these variables are shifted 30 minutes with respect to one another. This is because in ERA5, accumulated variables are recorded over the past hour, and in the process of cmorization, we shift the time coordinates to the middle of the interval over which is accumulated. However, computing daily statistics then averages the times, which results in 12:00 UTC for accumulated variables and 11:30 UTC for instantaneous variables. Therefore, in this diagnostic, the time coordinates of the daily instantaneous variables are shifted 30 minutes forward in time.

LISFLOOD
********
`LISFLOOD <https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/>`_ is a spatially distributed water resources model, developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission since 1997. We provide a recipe to produce meteorological forcing data for the Python 3 version of LISFLOOD.

LISFLOOD has a separate preprocessor LISVAP that derives some additional variables. We don't replace LISVAP. Rather, we provide input files that can readily be passed to LISVAP and then to LISFLOOD.


HYPE
****

The hydrological catchment model HYPE simulates water flow and substances on their way from precipitation through soil, river and lakes to the river outlet.
HYPE is developed at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The recipe pre-processes ERA-Interim and ERA5 data for use in HYPE.
