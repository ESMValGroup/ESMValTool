Surface trace gases
===================

Overview
--------

Available recipes and diagnostics
---------------------------------

Recipes are stored in esmvaltool/recipes/

    * recipe_surface_trace_gas_ch4.yml
    * recipe_surface_trace_gas_co2.yml
    * recipe_surface_trace_gas_n2o.yml

Diagnostics are stored in esmvaltool/diag_scripts/surface_trace_gases/

    * diagnostic_surface_trace_gases.py : Plots the different surface trace gas evaluations.
    * utils_surface_trace_gases.py: Utility functions used for the surface trace gas evaluation routines.

This diagnostic allows to produce 3 different types of analysis, typically
comparing station data and model data. In the case of zonal plots, the latitude
ranges considered are 60N - 90N, 30N - 60N, 30S - 30N, 90S - 30S.

    * Seasonal maps of the trace gas surface concentration overlaid with
      station data points. A complimentary scatter plot compares the surface
      concentration at the station locations with the model data extracted at
      these same locations for each season.
    * Zonal plots of surface concentration time series and seasonal cycle.
      The left column includes monthly surface concentration time series.
      The center-left column includes yearly surface concentration scatter plot.
      The center-right column includes multi-annual monthly anomaly.
      The right column includes yearly min/max months time series.
      The plot is inspired from Figure 8 of Folberth et al. (2018).
    * Zonal plots of surface concentration amplitude and growth.
      The left column includes yearly concentration amplitude time series.
      The center column includes yearly concentration growth time series.
      The right column includes yearly sensitivity of amplitude/growth.

Each analysis can be turned on or off using the argument *plots* in the recipe.
There is also the possibility for the two time series analysis plots to include
the zonal average of the model data and not just at the station locations using
the argument *only_multimodel* in the recipe. Furthermore, one can change how
the station data is pre-processed before plotting by filtering stations with
a minimum amount of data for months, seasons, years.

User settings in recipe
-----------------------

#. Preprocessor

  * ``extract_surface_from_atm`` : Extract surface from the input 3D
    atmospheric variable based on the surface pressure *ps*.

#. Script diagnostic_surface_trace_gases.py

  *Required settings for script*
  * trace_gas: The surface trace gas for which to run the evaluation.
  * min_mon_per_seas: The minimum number of months used to calculate each seasonal mean. This must be between 1 and 3. Recommended value is 3.
  * min_seas_per_year: The minimum number of seasonal means in each year. This must be between 1 and 4. Recommended value is 4.
  * min_seas_per_clim: The minimum number of seasonal means used to calculate the multiannual seasonal mean. This must be between 1 and the number of years of available NOAA GML Surface Flask data.

  *Optional settings for script*

  * plots: List of the diagnostics to plot among *seas_maps*, *timeserie_lat*,
    and sensitivi*ty_ampl_trend. Default is all of them.
  * only_multimodel: Boolean flag to indicate if only the diagnostics
    for the multimodel mean should be plotted. Default is *False*.

  *Required settings for variables*

  * None

  *Optional settings for variables*

  * None

  *Required settings for preprocessor*

  *Optional settings for preprocessor*

  * None


Variables
---------

The trace gas depends on the recipe used and can be one of the following:

* *ch4* (atmos, monthly mean, height longitude latitude time)
* *co2* (atmos, monthly mean, height longitude latitude time)
* *n2o* (atmos, monthly mean, height longitude latitude time)
* *ps* (atmos, monthly mean, longitude latitude time) as a supplementary
  variable for the `extract_surface_from_atm` preprocessor.

Observations and reformat scripts
---------------------------------

* The NOAA GML Surface Flask data is downloaded from the NOAA GML website
  using the downloaders:

  .. code-block:: yaml

        $ esmvaltool data download NOAA-GML-SURFACE-FLASK-CH4.
        $ esmvaltool data download NOAA-GML-SURFACE-FLASK-CO2.
        $ esmvaltool data download NOAA-GML-SURFACE-FLASK-N2O.

* The NOAA GML Surface Flask data is formatted using the formatters:

  .. code-block:: yaml

        $ esmvaltool data format NOAA-GML-SURFACE-FLASK-CH4.
        $ esmvaltool data format NOAA-GML-SURFACE-FLASK-CO2.
        $ esmvaltool data format NOAA-GML-SURFACE-FLASK-N2O.
