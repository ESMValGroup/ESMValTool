Sanity checks
=======

Overview
--------

The sanity check recipe (recipe_monitor_sanity_checks.yml) is intended to perform
some basic sanity checks for new simulations during model development. A subset of variables
is selected to check whether the model is performing in reasonable way. The recipe plots global
monthly means as well as maximum and minimum across all individual grid cells for each time step.
This can be used to check for example for negative mass concentrations occuring at any grid cell
at any time (minimum is less than zero) or whether individual grid cells exceed physically reasonalble
values (e.g. total cloud fraction greater than 100%).
The global monthly means can be compared to the minimum and maximum values found in reference
datasets (observations, reanalyses) across all months and all reference datasets. The "reasonable"
limits are shown as red lines. A good model simulations would be expected to not exceed these
limits at any time. The minimum and maximum global averages across all months and all reference
datasets is calculated with recipe_create_ranges_obs.yml

Available recipes and diagnostics
---------------------------------

Recipes are stored in `recipes/sanity_checks`

* recipe_monitor_sanity_checks.yml
* recipe_create_ranges_obs.yml

.. note::

  The time frequency used in recipe_create_ranges_obs.yml (monthly, daily, etc. values) to
  calculate "reasonable" minimum and maximum values must match the time frequency used in
  the sanity check recipe (recipe_monitor_sanity_checks.yml).

   Time series of monthly global average (solid line) and minimum / maximum
   (dashed lines) total cloud cover from MPI-ESM1-2-LR. The red horizontal lines
   show the monthly minimum and maximum global average across multiple reference
   dataset (here: ESACCI-CLOUD, CLARA-AVHRR, PATMOS-x, MODIS, ERA5) calculated
   with recipe_create_ranges_obs.yml. Plot created with recipe_monitor_sanity_checks.yml.
