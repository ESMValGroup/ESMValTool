IPCC AR5 Chapter 9 (selected figures)
=====================================

Overview
--------

The goal of this recipe is to collect diagnostics to reproduce Chapter 9 of AR5,
so that the plots can be readily reproduced and compared to previous CMIP
versions. In this way we can next time start with what was available in the
previous round and can focus on developing more innovative methods of analysis
rather than constantly having to "re-invent the wheel".

The plots are produced collecting the diagnostics from individual recipes. The
following figures from Flato et al. (2013) can currently be reproduced:

    * Figure 9.2 a,b,c: Annual-mean surface air temperature for the period
      1980-2005. a) multi-model mean, b) bias as the difference between the
      CMIP5 multi-model mean and the climatology from ERA-Interim
      (Dee et al., 2011), c) mean absolute model error with respect to the
      climatology from ERA-Interim.

    * Figure 9.3: Seasonality (December-January-February minus June-July-August)
      of surface (2 m) air temperature (°C) for the period 1980-2005.
      (a) Multi-model mean for the historical experiment. (b) Multi-model mean
      of absolute seasonality. (c) Difference between the multi-model mean
      and the ERA-Interim reanalysis seasonality. (d) Difference between the
      multi-model mean and the ERA-Interim absolute seasonality.

    * Figure 9.4: Annual-mean precipitation rate (mm day-1) for the period
      1980-2005. a) multi-model mean, b) bias as the difference between the
      CMIP5 multi-model mean and the climatology from the Global Precipitation
      Climatology Project (Adler et al., 2003), c) multi-model mean absolute
      error with respect to observations, and d) multi-model mean error
      relative to the multi-model mean precipitation ifself.

    * Figure 9.5: Climatological (1985-2005) annual-mean cloud radiative
      effects in Wm-2 for the CMIP5 models against CERES EBAF (2001-2011) in
      Wm-2. Top row shows the shortwave effect; middle row the longwave effect,
      and bottom row the net effect. Multi-model-mean biases against CERES
      EBAF 2.6 are shown on the left, whereas the right panels show zonal
      averages from CERES EBAF 2.6 (black), the individual CMIP5 models (thin
      gray lines), and the multi-model mean (thick red line).

    * Figure 9.6: Centred pattern correlations between models and observations 
      for the annual mean climatology over the period 1980–1999. Results are 
      shown for individual CMIP3 (black) and CMIP5 (blue) models as thin 
      dashes, along with the corresponding ensemble average (thick dash) and 
      median (open circle). The four variables shown are surface air 
      temperature (TAS), top of the atmosphere (TOA) outgoing longwave 
      radiation (RLUT), precipitation (PR) and TOA shortwave cloud radiative 
      effect (SW CRE). The correlations between the reference and alternate 
      observations are also shown (solid green circles).

    * Figure 9.8: Observed and simulated time series of the anomalies in annual
      and global mean surface temperature. All anomalies are differences from
      the 1961-1990 time-mean of each individual time series. The reference
      period 1961-1990 is indicated by yellow shading; vertical dashed grey
      lines represent times of major volcanic eruptions. Single simulations
      for CMIP5 models (thin lines); multi-model mean (thick red line);
      different observations (thick black lines). Dataset pre-processing like
      described in Jones et al., 2013.

    * Figure 9.14: Sea surface temperature plots for zonal mean error, equatorial
      (5 deg north to 5 deg south) mean error, and multi model mean for zonal error
      and equatorial mean.

    * Figure 9.24: Time series of (a) Arctic and (b) Antarctic sea ice extent;
      trend distributions of (c) September Arctic and (d) February Antarctic
      sea ice extent.

    * Figure 9.26: Ensemble-mean global ocean carbon uptake (a) and global land
      carbon uptake (b) in the CMIP5 ESMs for the historical period 1900–2005.
      For comparison, the observation-based estimates provided by the Global
      Carbon Project (GCP) are also shown (thick black line). The confidence
      limits on the ensemble mean are derived by assuming that the CMIP5 models
      are drawn from a t-distribution. The grey areas show the range of annual mean
      fluxes simulated across the model ensemble. This figure includes results
      from all CMIP5 models that reported land CO2 fluxes, ocean CO2 fluxes, or
      both (Anav et al., 2013).

    * Figure 9.27: Simulation of global mean (a) atmosphere–ocean CO2 fluxes
      ("fgCO2") and (b) net atmosphere–land CO2 fluxes ("NBP"), by ESMs for the
      period 1986–2005. For comparison, the observation-based estimates
      provided by Global Carbon Project (GCP) and the Japanese Meteorological
      Agency (JMA) atmospheric inversion are also shown. The error bars for the
      ESMs and observations represent interannual variability in the fluxes,
      calculated as the standard deviation of the annual means over the period
      1986–2005.

    * Figure 9.42a: Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) against the global
      mean surface air temperature, both for the period 1961-1990 and for the
      pre-industrial control runs.

    * Figure 9.42b: Transient climate response (TCR) against equilibrium climate
      sensitivity (ECS).

    * Figure 9.45a: Scatterplot of springtime snow-albedo effect values in climate
      change vs. springtime d(alpha\ :sub:`s`\)/d(T\ :sub:`s`\) values in the seasonal
      cycle in transient climate change experiments (Hall and Qu, 2006).
