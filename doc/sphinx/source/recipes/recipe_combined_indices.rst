.. _recipes_combined_indices:

Indices based on area averages
====================================================

Overview
--------

The goal of this diagnostic is to compute indices based on area averages.

In recipe_combined_indices.yml, after defining the period (historical or
future projection), the variable is selected. The predefined indices are:

* Nino 3
* Nino 3.4
* Nino 4
* North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
* Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)

Available recipes and diagnostics
-----------------------------------

Recipes are stored in recipes/

* recipe_combined_indices.yml

Diagnostics are stored in diag_scripts/magic_bsc/

* combined_indices.r : calculates the area-weighted means and multi-model means, with or without weights



User settings
-------------

User setting files are stored in recipes/

#. recipe_combined_indices.yml

   *Required settings for script*

   * region: one of the following strings Nino3, Nino3.4, Nino4, NAO, SOI
   * running_mean: an integer specifying the length of the window (in months) to be used for computing the running mean.
   * moninf: an integer can be given to determine the first month of the seasonal mean to be computed (from 1 to 12, corresponding to January to December respectively).
   * monsup: an integer specifying the last month to be computed (from 1 to 12, corresponding to January to December respectively).
   * standardized: ‘true’ or ‘false’ to specify whether to compute the standarization of the variable.


Variables
---------

* psl (atmos, monthly, longitude, latitude, time)
* tos (ocean, monthly, longitude, latitude, time)


Observations and reformat scripts
---------------------------------

*None*
