Climate model Weighting by Independence and Performance (ClimWIP)
=================================================================

Overview
--------

Projections of future climate change are often based on multi-model
ensembles of global climate models such as CMIP6. To condense the
information from these models they are often combined into
probabilistic estimates such as mean and a related uncertainty range
(such as the standard deviation). However, not all models in a given
multi-model ensemble are always equally ‘fit for purpose’ and it can
make sense to weight models based on their ability to simulate
observed quantities related to the target. In addition, multi-model
ensembles, such as CMIP can contain several models based on a very
similar code-base (sharing of components, only differences in
resolution etc.) leading to complex inter-dependencies between the
models. Adjusting for this by weighting models according to their
independence helps to adjust for this.


This recipe implements the **Climate model Weighting by Independence and Performance
(ClimWIP)** method. It is based on work by `Knutti et al. (2017) <https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL072012>`_,
`Lorenz et al. (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JD027992>`_,
`Brunner et al. (2019) <https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab492f>`_,
`Merrifield et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-807-2020>`_,
`Brunner et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-995-2020>`_. Weights are
calculated based on historical model performance in several metrics (which can be
defined by the ``performance_contributions`` parameter) as well as by their independence
to all the other models in the ensemble based on their output fields in several metrics
(which can be defined by the ``independence_contributions`` parameter). These weights
can be used in subsequent evaluation scripts (some of which are implemented as part of
this diagnostic).

**Note**: this recipe is still being developed! A more comprehensive (yet older)
implementation can be found on GitHub:  https://github.com/lukasbrunner/ClimWIP


Using shapefiles for cutting scientific regions
-----------------------------------------------

To use shapefiles for selecting SREX or AR6 regions by name it is necessary to download them, e.g.,
from the sources below and reference the file using the `shapefile` parameter. This can either be a
absolute or a relative path. In the example recipes they are stored in  a subfolder `shapefiles`
in the `auxiliary_data_dir` (with is specified in the
`config-user.yml <https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/ESMValCore/en/latest/quickstart/configure.html#user-configuration-file>`_).

User settings in recipe
-----------------------

1. Script ``main.py``

  *Required settings for script*
    * ``performance_sigma`` xor ``calibrate_performance_sigma``: If ``performance_contributions`` is given exactly one of the two
      has to be given. Otherwise they can be skipped or not set.

        * ``performance_sigma``: float setting the shape parameter for the performance weights calculation (determined offline).
        * ``calibrate_performance_sigma``: dictionary setting the performance sigma calibration. Has to contain at least the
          key-value pair specifying ``target``: ``variable_group``. Optional parameters for adjusting the calibration are not
          yet implemented. **Warning:** It is highly recommended to visually inspect the graphical output of the calibration to
          check if everything worked as intended. In case the calibration fails, the best performance sigma will still be
          indicated in the figure (see example :numref:`fig_climwip_5` below) but not automatically picked - the user can decide
          to use it anyway by setting it in the recipe (not recommenced).
    * ``independence_sigma``: float setting the shape parameter for the independence weights calculation (determined offline).
      Can be skipped or not set if ``independence_contributions`` is skipped or not set. A on-the-fly calculation of the
      independence sigma is not yet implemented
    * ``performance_contributions``: dictionary where the keys represent the variable groups to be included in the performance
      calculation. The values give the relative contribution of each group, with 0 being equivalent to not including the group.
      Can be skipped or not set then weights will be based purely on model independence (this is mutually exclusive with
      ``independence_contributions`` being skipped or not set).
    * ``independence_contributions``: dictionary where the keys represent the variable groups to be included in the independence
      calculation. The values give the relative contribution of each group, with 0 being equivalent to not including the group.
      If skipped or not set weights will be based purely on model performance (this is mutually exclusive with
      ``performance_contributions`` being skipped or not set).
    * ``combine_ensemble_members``: set to true if ensemble members of the same model should be combined during the processing
      (leads to identical weights for all ensemble members of the same model). Recommended if running with many (>10) ensemble
      members per model. If set to false, the model independence weighting will still (partly) account for the (very high)
      dependence between members of the same model. The success of this will depend on the case and the selected parameters.
      See `Merrifield et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-807-2020>`_ for an in-depth discussion.
    * ``obs_data``: list of project names to specify which are the observational data. The rest is assumed to be model data.

  *Required settings for variables*
  * This script takes multiple variables as input as long as they're available for all models
  * ``start_year``: provide the period for which to compute performance and independence.
  * ``end_year``: provide the period for which to compute performance and independence.
  * ``mip``: typically Amon
  * ``preprocessor``: e.g., climatological_mean
  * ``additional_datasets``: this should be ``*obs_data`` and is only needed for variables used in ``performance_contributions``.

  *Required settings for preprocessor*
    * Different combinations of preprocessor functions can be used, but the end result should always be aggregated over the time
      dimension, i.e. the input for the diagnostic script should be 2d (lat/lon).

  *Optional settings for preprocessor*
    * ``extract_region`` or ``extract_shape`` can be used to crop the input data.
    * ``extract_season`` can be used to focus on a single season.
    * different climate statistics can be used to calculate mean, (detrended) std_dev, or trend.

2. Script ``weighted_temperature_graph.py``

  *Required settings for script*
    * ``ancestors``: must include weights from previous diagnostic
    * ``weights``: the filename of the weights: 'weights.nc'
    * ``settings``: a list of plot settings: ``start_year`` (integer), ``end_year`` (integer), ``central_estimate`` ('mean' or integer between 0 and 100 giving the percentile), ``lower_bound`` (integer between 0 and 100), ``upper_bound`` (integer between 0 and 100)

  *Required settings for variables*
   * This script only takes temperature (tas) as input

   * ``mip``: typically Amon
   * ``preprocessor``: temperature_anomalies

  *Required settings for preprocessor*
    * Different combinations of preprocessor functions can be used, but the end result should always be aggregated over the
      latitude and longitude dimensions, i.e. the input for the diagnostic script should be 1d (time).

  *Optional settings for preprocessor*
    * Can be a global mean or focus on a point, region or shape
    * Anomalies can be calculated with respect to a custom reference period
    * Monthly, annual or seasonal average/extraction can be used

     * ``ancestors``: must include weights from previous diagnostic
     * ``weights``: the filename of the weights: 'weights_combined.nc'

   *Optional settings for script*

     * ``xticks``: positions to draw xticks at
     * ``yticks``: positions to draw yticks at

   *Required settings for variables*
     * This script takes temperature (tas) as input

     * A second variable is optional: temperature reference (tas_reference). If given, maps of temperature change to
       the reference are drawn, otherwise absolute temperatures are drawn.
     * tas_reference takes the same fields as tas


Updating the Brunner et al. (2019) recipe for new regions
---------------------------------------------------------

``recipe_climwip_brunner2019_med.yml`` demonstrates a very similar setup to `Brunner et al. (2019) <https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab492f>`_
but only for one region (the Mediterranean). To calculated weights for other regions the recipe needs to be updated in two places:

.. code-block:: yaml

    extract_shape:
       shapefile: shapefiles/srex.shp
       decomposed: True
       method: contains
       crop: true
       ids:
         - 'South Europe/Mediterranean [MED:13]'

The ``ids`` field takes any valid `SREX <http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/ar5_regions.html>`_ region
key or any valid `AR6 <https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/v1.6/reference-regions>`_ region key
(depending on the shapefile). Note that this needs to be the full string here (not the abbreviation).

The sigma parameters need to be set according to the selected region. The sigma values for the regions
used in `Brunner et al. (2019) <https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab492f>`_ can be found in table 1 of the paper.

.. code-block:: yaml

    performance_sigma: 0.546
    independence_sigma: 0.643

**Warning:** if a new region is used the sigma values should be recalculated! This can be done by commenting
out the sigma values (lines above) and commenting in the blocks defining the target of the weighting:

.. code-block:: yaml

    CLIM_future:
       short_name: tas
       start_year: 2081
       end_year: 2100
       mip: Amon
       preprocessor: region_mean

as well as

.. code-block:: yaml

    calibrate_performance_sigma:
       target: CLIM_future

In this case ClimWIP will attempt to perform an on-the-fly perfect model test to estimate the lowest
performance sigma (strongest weighting) which does not lead to overconfident weighting. **Important:**
the user should always check the test output for unusual behaviour. For most cases the performance sigma
should lie around 0.5. In cases where the perfect model test fails (no appropriate performance sigma
can be found) the test will still produce graphical output before raising a ValueError. The user can then decide
to manually set the performance sigma to the most appropriate value (based on the output) - **this is
not recommended** and should only be done with care! The perfect model test failing can be a hint for
one of the following: (1) not enough models in the ensemble for a robust distribution (normally >20
models should be used) or (2) the performance metrics used are not relevant for the target.

An on-the-fly calibration for the independence sigma is not yet implemented. For most cases we recommend to
use the same setup as in `Brunner et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-995-2020>`_ or
`Merrifield et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-807-2020>`_ (global or hemispherical
temperature and sea level pressure climatologies as metrics and independence sigma values between 0.2
and 0.5).

**Warning:** if a new region or target is used the provided metrics to establish the weights
might no longer be appropriate. Using unrelated metrics with no correlation and/or physical
relation to the target will reduce the skill of the weighting and ultimately render it useless! In
such cases the perfect model test might fail. This means the performance metrics should be updated.


Brunner et al. (2020) recipe and example independence weighting
---------------------------------------------------------------

``recipe_climwip_brunner2020esd.yml`` implements the weighting used in `Brunner et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-995-2020>`_. Compared to the paper there are minor differences due to two models which had to be excluded due to errors in the ESMValTool pre-processor: CAMS-CSM1-0 and MPI-ESM1-2-HR (r2) as well as the use of only one observational dataset (ERA5).

The recipe uses an additional step between pre-processor and weight calculation to calculate anomalies relative to the global mean (e.g., tas_ANOM = tas_CLIM - global_mean(tas_CLIM)). This means we do not use the absolute temperatures of a model as performance criterion but rather the horizontal temperature distribution (see `Brunner et al. 2020 <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-995-2020>`_ for a discussion).

This recipe also implements a somewhat general independence weighting for CMIP6. In contrast to model performance (which should be case specific) model independence can largely be seen as only dependet on the multi-model ensemble in use but not the target variable or region. This means that the configuration used should be valid for similar subsets of CMIP6 as used in this recipe:


.. code-block:: yaml

   combine_ensemble_members: true
   independence_sigma: 0.54
   independence_contributions:
       tas_CLIM_i: 1
       psl_CLIM_i: 1

Note that this approach weights ensemble members of the same model with a 1/N independence scaling (combine_ensemble_members: true) as well as different models with an output-based independence weighting. Different approaches to handle ensemble members are discussed in `Merrifield et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-807-2020>`_. Note that, unlike for performance, climatologies are used for independence (i.e., the global mean is **not** removed for independence). **Warning:** Using only the independence weighting without any performance weighting might not always lead to meaningful results! The independence weighting is based on model output, which means that if a model is very different from all other models as well as the observations it will get a very high independence weight (and also total weight in absence of any performance weighting). This might not reflect the actual independence. It is therefore recommended to use weights based on both independence and performance for most cases.


Variables
---------

* pr (atmos, monthly mean, longitude latitude time)
* tas (atmos, monthly mean, longitude latitude time)
* psl (atmos, monthly mean, longitude latitude time)
* rsus, rsds, rlus, rlds, rsns, rlns (atmos, monthly mean, longitude latitude time)
* more variables can be added if available for all datasets.

   reach at least 80%. The thick grey line gives the mean change in spread between the unweighted and weighted 80% ranges as an
   indication of the weighting strength (if it reaches 1, the weighting has no effect on uncertainty). The smallest sigma (i.e.,
   strongest weighting) which is not overconfident (reliability >= 80%) is selected. If the test fails (like in this example) the
   smallest sigma which comes closest to 80% will be indicated in the legend (but NOT automatically selected).
