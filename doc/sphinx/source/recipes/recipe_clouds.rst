Clouds
======

Overview
--------

The recipe recipe_lauer13jclim.yml computes the climatology and interannual
variability of climate relevant cloud variables such as cloud radiative forcing
(CRE), liquid water path (lwp), cloud amount (clt), and total precipitation (pr)
reproducing some of the evaluation results of Lauer and Hamilton (2013). The
recipe includes a comparison of the geographical distribution of multi-year
average cloud parameters from individual models and the multi-model mean with
satellite observations. Taylor diagrams are generated that show the multi-year
annual or seasonal average performance of individual models and the multi-model
mean in reproducing satellite observations. The diagnostic also facilitates the
assessment of the bias of the multi-model mean and zonal averages of individual
models compared with satellite observations. Interannual variability is
estimated as the relative temporal standard deviation from multi-year timeseries
of data with the temporal standard deviations calculated from monthly anomalies
after subtracting the climatological mean seasonal cycle.

   effect; middle row the longwave effect, and bottom row the net effect.
   Multi-model mean biases against CERES EBAF are shown on the left, whereas the
   right panels show zonal averages from CERES EBAF (thick black), the
   individual CMIP5 models (thin gray lines) and the multi-model mean (thick
   red line). Similar to Figure 9.5 of Flato et al. (2013).

.. _fig_cloud_4:

   :align:   center

   Interannual variability of modeled and observed (GPCP) precipitation rates
   estimated as relative temporal standard deviation from 20 years (1986-2005)
   of data. The temporal standard devitions are calculated from monthly
   anomalies after subtracting the climatological mean seasonal cycle.
