Sea Surface Salinity Evaluation
===============================

Overview
--------

This recipe compares the regional means of sea surface salinity with a
reference dataset (ESACCI-SEA-SURFACE-SALINITY v1 or v2 by default).
To do this, the recipe generates plots for the timeseries of each region and
a radar plot showing the correlation between dataset and reference timeseries for
each region during the time they both exist.

Preprocessor requirements:
--------------------------

The recipe is created in a way that should make possible (although is not
tested) to use it for other variables and datasets, even for more than one at
a time. The diagnostic only expects variables with dimensions `time` and `depth_id`
and it does not assume any other constraint.

It is therefore mandatory to keep the `extract_shape` preprocessor for more than
one region and any form of region operation (`mean`, `max`, `min` ...) to collapse
the `latitude` and `longitude` coordinates. In case you want to try with variables
that have extra dimensions (i.e. `depth`) you must add an extra preprocessor
call to collapse them (i.e. `depth_integration`)

The recipe can be used with any shapefile. As it is, it uses the IHO Sea Areas
(version 3) downloaded from https://marineregions.org/downloads.php, but any
shapefile containing marine regions can be used.

Any number of regions can be choosed also, even though plots may look odd if
too few or too many are selected.
