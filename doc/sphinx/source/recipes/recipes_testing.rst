.. _recipes_testing:

Short test versions of scientific recipes to check for backward compatibility.
==========================================================================================================================

Overview
--------


These recipes are created to cover typical functionalities in the ESMValTool and allow to test them quickly.
Each recipe should run less than 5 minutes to facilitate fast tests.


Available recipes and diagnostics
---------------------------------

Recipes are stored in recipes/testing/

   * recipe_deangelis15nat_fig1_fast.yml

Diagnostics are stored in diag_scripts/

   * deangelis15nat/deangelisf1b.py

Other recipes used for the continuous integration (CI) tests; these
are run only by the automated tests:

   * recipe_python_for_CI.yml

This is identical to the example Python recipe, with the only difference being
the location extraction preprocessor, which is replaced here with ``extract_point``.
The reason for this is that this recipe is used solely for CI tests,
and the geolocator/Nominatim engine for location extraction should not be used
in CI runs as per their usage policy. 

User settings in recipes
------------------------

The recipe recipe_deangelis15nat_fig1_fast.yml calls the first diagnostic (deangelisf1b.py) from the original recipe recipe_deangelis15nat.yml.
It can be run with CMIP5 and CMIP6 models for any duration.
Several flux variables (W m\ :sup:`-2`\) and up to 6 different model experiments can be handled.
Each variable needs to be given for each model experiment. The same experiments must
be given for all models. For testing purpose it was reduce to two models, 3 experiments and one year.
