Blocking metrics and indices, teleconnections and weather regimes (MiLES)
=========================================================================


Overview
--------

Atmospheric blocking is a recurrent mid-latitude weather pattern identified by a large-amplitude, quasi-stationary, long-lasting, high-pressure anomaly that ‘‘blocks’’ the westerly flow forcing the jet stream to split or meander
`(Rex, 1950) <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1111%2Fj.2153-3490.1950.tb00331.x>`_.

It is typically initiated by the breaking of a Rossby wave in a diffluence region at the exit of the storm track, where it amplifies the underlying stationary ridge `(Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990) <https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0870.1990.t01-2-00003.x>`_.
Blocking occurs more frequently in the Northern Hemisphere cold season, with larger frequencies observed over the Euro-Atlantic and North Pacific sectors. Its lifetime oscillates from a few days up to several weeks `(Davini et al., 2012)  <https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00032.1)>`_ sometimes leading to winter cold spells or summer heat waves.

To this end, the MId-Latitude Evaluation System (MiLES) was developed as stand-alone package (https://github.com/oloapinivad/MiLES) to support analysis of mid-latitude weather patterns in terms of atmospheric blocking, teleconnections and weather regimes. The package was then implemented as recipe for ESMValTool.

The tool works on daily 500hPa geopotential height data (with data interpolated on a common 2.5x2.5 grid) and calculates the following diagnostics:

1D Atmospheric Blocking
***********************
`Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) <https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0870.1990.t01-2-00003.x>`_ index for Northern Hemisphere. Computed at fixed latitude of 60N, with delta of -5,-2.5,0,2.5,5 deg, fiN=80N and fiS=40N. Full timeseries and climatologies are provided in NetCDF4 Zip format.

2D Atmospheric blocking
***********************
Following the index by `Davini et al. (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00032.1>`_. It is a 2D version of `Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) <https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0870.1990.t01-2-00003.x>`_ for Northern Hemisphere atmospheric blocking evaluating meridional gradient reversal at 500hPa. It computes both Instantaneous Blocking and Blocking Events frequency, where the latter allows the estimation of the each blocking duration. It includes also two blocking intensity indices, i.e. the Meridional Gradient Index and the Blocking Intensity index. In addition the orientation (i.e. cyclonic or anticyclonic) of the Rossby wave breaking is computed. A supplementary Instantaneous Blocking index with the GHGS2 condition (see `Davini et al., 2012 <https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00032.1>`_) is also evaluated.
Full timeseries and climatologies are provided in NetCDF4 Zip format.

Z500 Empirical Orthogonal Functions
***********************************
Based on SVD. The first 4 EOFs for North Atlantic (over the 90W-40E 20N-85N box) and Northern Hemisphere (20N-85N) or a custom region are computed. North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic Pattern, and Arctic Oscillation can be evaluated.
Figures showing linear regression of PCs on monthly Z500 are provided. PCs and eigenvectors, as well as the variances explained are provided in NetCDF4 Zip format.

North Atlantic Weather Regimes
******************************
Following k-means clustering of 500hPa geopotential height. 4 weather regimes over North Atlantic (80W-40E 30N-87.5N) are evaluated using anomalies from daily seasonal cycle. This is done retaining the first North Atlantic EOFs which explains the 80% of the variance to reduce the phase-space dimensions and then applying k-means clustering using Hartigan-Wong algorithm with k=4. Figures report patterns and frequencies of occurrence. NetCDF4 Zip data are saved. Only 4 regimes and DJF supported so far.
