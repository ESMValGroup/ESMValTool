IPCC AR6 Chapter 3 (selected figures)
=====================================

Overview
--------

This recipe collects selected diagnostics used in IPCC AR6 WGI Chapter 3: 
Human influence on the climate system. Plots from IPCC AR6 can be readily
reproduced and compared to previous versions. The aim is to be able to start
with what was available now the next time allowing us to
focus on developing more innovative analysis methods
rather than constantly having to "re-invent the wheel".

The plots are produced collecting the diagnostics from individual recipes. The
following figures from Eyring et al. (2021) can currently be reproduced:

    * Figure 3.3 a,b,c,d: Surface Air Temperature - Model Bias

    * Figure 3.4: Anomaly Of Near-Surface Air Temperature

    * Figure 3.5: Temporal Variability Of Near-Surface Air Temperature

    * Figure 3.13: Precipitation - Model Bias

    * Figure 3.15: Precipitation Anomaly

   :align:   center

   Figure 3.3: Annual mean near-surface (2 m) air temperature (°C) for the
   period 1995–2014. (a) Multi-model (ensemble) mean constructed with one
   realization of the CMIP6 historical experiment from each model. (b)
   Multi-model mean bias, defined as the difference between the CMIP6
   multi-model mean and the climatology of the fifth generation European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis
   of the global climate (ERA5). (c) Multi-model mean of the root mean square
   error calculated over all months separately and averaged, with respect to
   the climatology from ERA5. Uncertainty is represented using the advanced
   approach: No overlay indicates regions with robust signal, where ≥66% of
   models show change greater than the variability threshold and ≥80% of all
   models agree on sign of change; diagonal lines indicate regions with no
   change or no robust signal, where <66% of models show a change greater
   than the variability threshold; crossed lines indicate regions with
   conflicting signal, where ≥66% of models show change greater than the
   variability threshold and <80% of all models agree on sign of change.

   Figure 3.4a: Observed and simulated time series of the anomalies in annual
   and global mean surface air temperature (GSAT). All anomalies are
   differences from the 1850–1900 time-mean of each individual time series.
   The reference period 1850–1900 is indicated by grey shading. (a) Single
   simulations from CMIP6 models (thin lines) and the multi-model mean (thick
   red line). Observational data (thick black lines) are from the Met Office
   Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit dataset (HadCRUT5), and are blended
   surface temperature (2 m air temperature over land and sea surface
   temperature over the ocean). All models have been subsampled using the
   HadCRUT5 observational data mask. Vertical lines indicate large historical
   volcanic eruptions. Inset: GSAT for each model over the reference period,
   not masked to any observations.

   Figure 3.4b: Observed and simulated time series of the anomalies in annual
   and global mean surface air temperature (GSAT). All anomalies are
   differences from the 1850–1900 time-mean of each individual time series.
   The reference period 1850–1900 is indicated by grey shading. (b) Multi-model
   means of CMIP5 (blue line) and CMIP6 (red line) ensembles and associated 5th
   to 95th percentile ranges (shaded regions). Observational data are HadCRUT5,
   Berkeley Earth, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   NOAAGlobalTemp and Kadow et al. (2020). Masking was done as in (a). CMIP6
   historical simulations were extended with SSP2-4.5 simulations for the
   period 2015–2020 and CMIP5 simulations were extended with RCP4.5 simulations
   for the period 2006–2020. All available ensemble members were used. The
   multi-model means and percentiles were calculated solely from simulations
   available for the whole time span (1850–2020).

   Figure 3.5: The standard deviation of annually averaged zonal-mean
   near-surface air temperature. This is shown for four detrended observed
   temperature datasets (HadCRUT5, Berkeley Earth, NOAAGlobalTemp and Kadow et
   al. (2020), for the years 1995-2014) and 59 CMIP6 pre-industrial control
   simulations (one ensemble member per model, 65 years) (after Jones et al.,
   2013). For line colours see the legend of Figure 3.4. Additionally, the
   multi-model mean (red) and standard deviation (grey shading) are shown.
   Observational and model datasets were detrended by removing the
   least-squares quadratic trend.

   Figure 3.13:  Annual-mean precipitation rate (mm day–1) for the period
   1995–2014. (a) Multi-model (ensemble) mean constructed with one realization
   of the CMIP6 historical experiment from each model. (b) Multi-model mean
   bias, defined as the difference between the CMIP6 multi-model mean and
   precipitation analysis from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project
   (GPCP) version 2.3 (Adler et al., 2003). (c) Multi-model mean of the root
   mean square error calculated over all months separately and averaged with
   respect to the precipitation analysis from GPCP version 2.3. Uncertainty is
   represented using the advanced approach. No overlay indicates regions with
   robust signal, where ≥66% of models show change greater than the variability
   threshold and ≥80% of all models agree on sign of change; diagonal lines
   indicate regions with no change or no robust signal, where <66% of models
   show a change greater than the variability threshold; crossed lines indicate
   regions with conflicting signal, where ≥66% of models show change greater
   than the variability threshold and <80% of all models agree on the sign of
   change.

   Figure 3.15: Observed and simulated time series of anomalies in zonal
   average annual mean precipitation. (a), (c–f) Evolution of global and zonal
   average annual mean precipitation (mm day–1) over areas of land where there
   are observations, expressed relative to the base period of 1961–1990,
   simulated by CMIP6 models (one ensemble member per model) forced with both
   anthropogenic and natural forcings (brown) and natural forcings only
   (green). Multi-model means are shown in thick solid lines and shading
   shows the 5–95% confidence interval of the individual model simulations.
   The data is smoothed using a low pass filter. Observations from three
   different datasets are included: gridded values derived from Global
   Historical Climatology Network (GHCN version 2) station data, updated
   from Zhang et al. (2007), data from the Global Precipitation Climatology
   Product (GPCP L3 version 2.3, Adler et al. (2003)) and from the Climate
   Research Unit (CRU TS4.02, Harris et al. (2014)). Also plotted are
   boxplots showing interquartile and 5–95% ranges of simulated trends over
   the period for simulations forced with both anthropogenic and natural
   forcings (brown) and natural forcings only (blue). Observed trends for each
   observational product are shown as horizontal lines. Panel (b) shows annual
   mean precipitation rate (mm day–1) of GHCN version 2 for the years 1950–2014
   over land areas used to compute the plots.
