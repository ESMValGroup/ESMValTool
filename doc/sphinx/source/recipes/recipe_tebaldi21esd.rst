Climate model projections from the ScenarioMIP of CMIP6
=======================================================


Overview
--------

This recipe is implemented into ESMValTool to evaluate the temperature and precipitation changes from the ScenarioMIP of CMIP6. It produces the original plots and tables of Tebaldi et al. (2021), https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-253-2021

Available recipe and diagnostics

* calc_timeseries_across_realization_stddev_runave.ncl: computes time series of ensemble spreads (i.e., inter-member standard deviations). One dataset is used for resampling subsets of 10 members.
* calc_cmip6_and_cmip5_pattern_diff_scaleT.ncl: computes the pattern difference between the CMIP6 multi-model mean change and the CMIP5 multi-model mean change.
* calc_IAV_hatching.ncl: computes the interannual variability (IAV) over
  piControl runs, either over the whole time period or in chunks over
  some years.
* calc_pattern_diff_scaleT.ncl: computes the map of multi-model mean change
  scaled by global T change.
* calc_pattern_stippling_hatching.ncl: computes the map of multi-model mean change
  with stippling for significant region and hatching for non-significant
  region. Significant is where the multi-model mean change is greater
  than two standard deviations of the internal variability and where at
  least 90% of the models agree on the sign of change. Not significant is
  where the multi-model mean change is less than one standard deviation of
  internal variability.

  standard deviation of the change scaled by global T change
* calc_pattern_stddev_scaleT.ncl: computes the standard deviation of the
  change scaled by global T change
* calc_pattern_comparison.ncl: computes the difference between the patterns of
  multi-model mean change of two different scenarios (ex: SSP4-6.0 and SSP4-3.4)
* calc_table_changes.ncl: computes the changes (mean and spreads) for the
  specified scenarios and time periods relative to the historical
  baseline.
* calc_table_warming_level.ncl: computes the warming level crossing year
  (mean, five percent and ninety-five percent quantiles of crossing
  years) for specified scenarios and warming levels.
* calc_timeseries_mean_spread_runave.ncl: computes
  multi-model time series of change against historical baseline for
  specified scenarios with spread. A running average with specified window
  is performed.
* calc_timeseries_mean_spread_ssp4.ncl: computes
  multi-model time series of change against historical baseline for
  specified ssp434 and ssp460 with spread. A running average with specified
  window is performed.
* calc_timeseries_mean_spread_ssp5.ncl: computes multi-model time series
  of change against historical baseline for ssp534-over and ssp585 with spread.
  A running average with specified window is performed.
* plot_pattern.ncl: plots a pattern.
* plot_table_changes: plots a table of the multi-model mean and spread for
  specified scenarios and periods.
* plot_table_warming_level.ncl: plots a table of warming level crossing
  years for specified scenarios (columns) and warming levels (rows).

  model mean and spread) for 3 scenarios.

  time series with brackets for constrained projections.

   Global average temperature time series (11-year running averages) of changes
   from current baseline (1995–2014, left axis) and pre-industrial baseline
   (1850–1900, right axis, obtained by adding a 0.84 ◦C offset) for SSP1-1.9,
   SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5.

   Patterns of temperature (a) and percent precipitation change (b) normalized
   by global average temperature change (averaged across CMIP6 models and all
   Tier 1 plus SSP1-1.9 scenarios).

   Times (best estimate and range – in square brackets – based on the 5 %–95 %
   range of the ensemble after smoothing the trajectories by 11-year running
   means) at which various warming levels (defined as relative to 1850–1900)
   are reached according to simulations following, from left to right, SSP1-1.9,
   SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. Crossing of these levels is
   defined by using anomalies with respect to 1995–2014 for the model ensembles
   and adding the offset of 0.84  to derive warming from pre-industrial values.
   We use a common subset of 31 models for the Tier 1 scenarios and all
   available models (13) for SSP1-1.9, while Table A7 shows the result of using
   all available models under each scenario. The number of models available
   under each scenario and the number of models reaching a given warming
   level are shown in parentheses. However, the estimates are based on the
   ensemble means and ranges computed from all the models considered (13 or 31
   in this case), not just from the models that reach a given level. An
   estimate marked as “NA” is to be interpreted as “not reaching that warming
   level by 2100”. In cases where the ensemble average remains below the warming
   level for the whole century, it is possible for the central estimate to be NA,
   while the earlier time of the confidence interval is not, since it is
   determined by the warmer end of the ensemble range.
