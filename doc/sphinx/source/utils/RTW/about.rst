The Recipe Test Workflow (|RTW|) is a workflow that is used to regularly run
recipes so issues can be discovered during the development process sooner
rather than later.

|Cylc| v8 and |Rose| v2 are used as the workflow engine and application
configuration system for the |RTW|, respectively. |Cylc| and |Rose| are not
included in the ESMValTool environment as they are typically already centrally
installed at sites e.g. JASMIN and the Met Office.
