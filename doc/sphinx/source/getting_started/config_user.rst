.. _config-user:

***********************
User configuration file
***********************

The ``config-user.yml`` configuration file contains all the global level
information needed by ESMValTool. The following shows the default settings from
the ``config-user.yml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

  # Diagnostics create plots? [true]/false
  write_plots: true
  # Diagnositcs write NetCDF files? [true]/false
  write_netcdf: true
  # Set the console log level debug, [info], warning, error
  log_level: info
  # verbosity is deprecated and will be removed in the future
  # verbosity: 1
  # Exit on warning? true/[false]
  exit_on_warning: false
  # Plot file format? [ps]/pdf/png/eps/epsi
  output_file_type: pdf
  # Destination directory
  output_dir: ./esmvaltool_output
  # Auxiliary data directory (used for some additional datasets)
  auxiliary_data_dir: ./auxiliary_data
  # Use netCDF compression true/[false]
  compress_netcdf: false
  # Save intermediary cubes in the preprocessor true/[false]
  save_intermediary_cubes: false
  # Remove the preproc dir if all fine
  remove_preproc_dir: true
  # Run at most this many tasks in parallel null/[1]/2/3/4/..
  # Set to null to use the number of available CPUs.
  # Make sure your system has enough memory for the specified number of tasks.
  max_parallel_tasks: 1
  # Path to custom config-developer file, to customise project configurations.
  # See config-developer.yml for an example. Set to None to use the default
  config_developer_file: null
  # Get profiling information for diagnostics
  # Only available for Python diagnostics
  profile_diagnostic: false

  # Rootpaths to the data from different projects (lists are also possible)
  rootpath:
    CMIP5: [~/cmip5_inputpath1, ~/cmip5_inputpath2]
    OBS: ~/obs_inputpath
    default: ~/default_inputpath

  # Directory structure for input data: [default]/BADC/DKRZ/ETHZ/etc
  # See config-developer.yml for definitions.
  drs:
    CMIP5: default

Most of these settings are fairly self-explanatory, ie:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # Diagnostics create plots? [true]/false
  write_plots: true
  # Diagnositcs write NetCDF files? [true]/false
  write_netcdf: true

The ``write_plots`` setting is used to inform ESMValTool about your preference
for saving figures. Similarly, the ``write_netcdf`` setting is a boolean which
turns on or off the writing of netCDF files.

.. code-block:: yaml

  # Auxiliary data directory (used for some additional datasets)
  auxiliary_data_dir: ~/auxiliary_data

The ``auxiliary_data_dir`` setting is the path to place any required
additional auxiliary data files. This method was necessary because certain
Python toolkits such as cartopy will attempt to download data files at run
time, typically geographic data files such as coastlines or land surface maps.
This can fail if the machine does not have access to the wider internet. This
location allows us to tell cartopy (and other similar tools) where to find the
files if they can not be downloaded at runtime. To reiterate, this setting is
not for model or observational datasets, rather it is for data files used in
plotting such as coastline descriptions and so on.


.. note::

   The ``config-user.yml`` file is specified as argument at run time, so it is
   possible to have several available with different purposes: one for
   formalised runs, one for debugging, etc...
