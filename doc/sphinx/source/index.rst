Welcome to ESMValTool's documentation!
======================================

**ESMValTool** is a community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth System Models (ESMs) that allows for
routine comparison of models and observations. It includes a large collection of community recipes and observation data formatters to CMOR standards.

**ESMValCore** is a software package which provides the core functionality for ESMValTool. It is a workflow to find CMIP data, and apply
commonly used pre-processing functions.

To get a first impression of what ESMValTool and ESMValCore can do for you,
have a look at our blog posts
`Analysis-ready climate data with ESMValCore <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/easy-ipcc-powered-by-esmvalcore-19a0b6366ea7>`_
and
`ESMValTool: Recipes for solid climate science <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/esmvaltool-recipes-for-solid-climate-science-da5b33814f69>`_.


Basic documentation schema
--------------------------
This gives a brief idea of topics in each of the packages to help find information. As ESMValTool encompasses ESMValCore there will be some overlap between them.
For more detailed information, see documentation navigation to the left. Please also see
`ESMValCore documentation <https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/ESMValCore/en/latest/index.html>`_. ESMValCore can be used without ESMValTool such as in Jupyter
notebooks.
