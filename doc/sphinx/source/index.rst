Welcome to ESMValTool's documentation!
======================================

To get a first impression of what ESMValTool and ESMValCore can do for you,
have a look at our blog posts
`Analysis-ready climate data with ESMValCore <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/easy-ipcc-powered-by-esmvalcore-19a0b6366ea7>`_
and
`ESMValTool: Recipes for solid climate science <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/esmvaltool-recipes-for-solid-climate-science-da5b33814f69>`_.

A tutorial is available on https://tutorial.esmvaltool.org.

A series of video lectures has been created by `ACCESS-NRI <https://access-nri.org.au>`_.
While these are tailored for ACCESS users, they are still very informative.
