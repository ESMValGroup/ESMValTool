"""
This script is part of the ESMValTool distribution.  It's been added as part of the incorporation
of the Sphinx documentation generator.  Sphinx was originally developed for documenting Python code, 
and one of its features is that it is able - using the so-called autodoc extension - to extract 
documentation strings from Python source files and use them in the documentation it generates.  

The autodoc feature apparently does not exist for NCL source files (such as those which are used in 
ESMValTool), but it has been mimicked (or - more-or-less - reverse-engineered) here via this script,
which walks through a subset of the ESMValTool NCL scripts, extracts function names, argument lists 
and descriptions (from the comments immediately following the function definition), and assembles 
them in a subdirectory of doc/sphinx/source.  These output files are in the so-called reStructuredText 
format (see, e.g., http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), which is the markup language used by 
Sphinx; running make in doc/sphinx builds the ESMValTool documentation from them, as noted above.
