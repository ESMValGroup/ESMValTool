Introduction
============

The ESMValTool is a software package used to compare and visualize
climate data sets. The tool reads climate data from CMIP5 compliant
netCDF files and generates output in postscript, pdf, png or
netCDF-files. This document gives a practical overview of the tool;
describing its background, the project workflow, the control flow of
the tool and basic operations such as configuring it to produce a
certain plot/variable, how to add new plot scripts/variables. Specific
issues are further explained in  the :ref:`my-reference-label`. 
For a more hands-on approach, see the :ref:`my-tutorial-label`. 

The tool is directly built upon the Chemistry-Climate-eValuation Tool 
[CCMVal]_.  For an in-depth technical discussion on the purpose and
possibilities with ESMValTool, please see the corresponding discussion
for CCMVal [CCMVal]_.
