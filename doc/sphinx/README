This README is part of the ESMValTool distribution.  It's been added as part of 
the incorporation of the Sphinx documentation generator. 

This distribution includes the ESMValTool documentation in the form of 
standalone HTML files in the build/html directory; pointing your browser at

% build/html/index.html

in the current directory (i.e. the directory which contains this README file) 
will load the documentation.

The installation of Sphinx is a prerequisite for the (re-)generation of the 
ESMValTool documentation.  Sphinx may be obtained from 
http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html; an overview of its workings is available 
at http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html.

The script process_ncl_docs.py in the scripts directory creates input files for 
Sphinx from a subset of ESMValTool NCL scripts, and assembles them in a 
subdirectory of the source directory.  To create the ESMValTool documentation,
first run this script by doing

% python scripts/process_ncl_docs.py

in the current directory.  Then, run 

% make <target>

in the same directory to ask Sphinx to generate the documentation.  Here, 
<target> is the output format required for the documentation - for example, 
html for standalone HTML files (as distributed here), man for manual pages and 
text for plain text.  The output is placed in the build/<target> subdirectory.  
Running 

% make

by itself will generate a complete list of output formats.
