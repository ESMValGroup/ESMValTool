# This is a python config file used to store global variables used throughout any code that uses:
# make_plots.py, valmod.py, rms.py
# http://dev.fyicenter.com/Interview-Questions/Python/How_do_I_share_global_variables_across_modules_.html

# The defaults are:

# ************* FLAGS **************

error=False   # Flag to say that an error has occured somewhere
debug=False   # Flag to say we are using debug mode
pub=False     # Flag to say this is for a publication. Don't output UMUI jobids or Rose suiteids in the final plot headers.
valnote=False # Flag to say we are doing a validation note

# ************ GENERAL VARIABLES *************

plot_type='lat_lon'   # What type of plot are we plotting
rms_first_letter='a'  # What is the first plot letter (key) to calculate RMS values for
extra_data_dict={}    # A dictionary containing extra data of land sea masks and grids at different resolutions
missing_data=-999     # A missing data indicator number

# *********** VARIABLES USED BY VALIDATION NOTES *****************

item_dict={}          # A dictionary referencing items to their stash codes and pre-processing options
levels_dict={}        # A dictionary referencing plots to their levels, colours and post-processing options
plots_dict={}         # A dictionary referencing what equations are used to make each plot
valorder_file='none'   # Full path to the valorder file used.
