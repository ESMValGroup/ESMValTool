# 2008/08/22 C. Fischer

# Changes
# 2008/08/27 CAF  Added check to see if files exist, if they do then
#                 don't process
# 2008/11/06 CAF  Changed shell call from csh script to ncl script,
#                 added ensemble id
# 2008-11-18 CAF  Added climo directory
# 2008-11-18 CAF  replace system call with popen
# 2009-01-27 CAF  added end_year and start_year to enviroment variables
#                 in order to create output filename.
#                 also changed climo dir structure
# 2009-05-28 CAF  fixed problem with current working directory
# 2009-06-11 CAF  added date range check to input file
# 2010-12-14 HS/SWW changed input directory and input files & output
# 2011-02-01 ZL   re-introduced one of input filename for ccsm
# 2012-05-11 HS   added a call to test_timerange.ncl,
#                 check time range for T*M*
# 2014-11-27 BvU  added optional horizontal and vertical grid files

# Known issues:

# What it does:
#  -  Sets environment variables then calls a csh script to convert the file
